  <p>What is meant by the phrase "specific stability;" such stability to be
  expected <i>a priori</i>, or else considerable changes at
  once.&mdash;Rapidly increasing difficulty of intensifying race

<h2>THE GENESIS OF SPECIES.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><i>INTRODUCTORY.</i></p>

  probable solution.&mdash;Importance of the question.&mdash;Position here

  Plants under Domestication."&mdash;Difficulties of the Darwinian theory
  enumerated.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The great problem which has so long exercised the minds of
  naturalists, namely, that concerning the origin of different kinds of
  animals and plants, seems at last to be fairly on the road to
  receive&mdash;perhaps at no very distant future&mdash;as satisfactory a
  solution as it can well have.</p>

  <p>But the problem presents peculiar difficulties. The birth of a
  "species" has often been compared with that of an "individual." The
  origin, however, of even an individual animal or plant (that which
  determines an embryo to evolve itself,&mdash;as, <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span><i>e.g.</i>, a spider
  rather than a beetle, a rose-plant rather than a pear) is shrouded in
  obscurity. <i>A fortiori</i> must this be the case with the origin of a
  "species."</p>

  <p>Moreover, the analogy between a "species" and an "individual" is a
  very incomplete one. The word "individual" denotes a concrete whole with
  a real, separate, and distinct existence. The word "species," on the
  other hand, denotes a peculiar congeries of characters, innate powers and
  qualities, and a certain nature realized indeed in individuals, but
  having no separate existence, except ideally as a thought in some
  mind.</p>

  <p>Thus the birth of a "species" can only be compared metaphorically, and
  very imperfectly, with that of an "individual."</p>

  <p>Individuals as <i>individuals</i>, actually and directly produce and
  bring forth other individuals; but no "congeries of characters" no
  "common nature" <i>as such</i>, can directly bring forth another "common
  nature," because, <i>per se</i>, it has no existence (other than ideal)
  apart from the individuals in which it is manifested.</p>

  <p>The problem then is, "by what combination of natural laws does a new
  'common nature' appear upon the scene of realized existence?" <i>i.e.</i>
  how is an individual embodying such new characters produced?</p>

  <p>For the approximation we have of late made towards the solution of
  this problem, we are mainly indebted to the invaluable labours and active
  brains of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, important as has been the impulse and direction given by
  those writers to both our observations and speculations, the solution
  will not (if the views here advocated are correct) ultimately present
  that aspect and character with which it has issued from the hands of
  those writers.</p>

  <p>Neither, most certainly, will that solution agree in appearance or
  substance with the more or less crude conceptions which have been put
  forth by most of the opponents of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace. <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span></p>

  <p>Rather, judging from the more recent manifestations of thought on
  opposite sides, we may expect the development of some <i>tertium
  quid</i>&mdash;the resultant of forces coming from different quarters,
  and not coinciding in direction with any one of them.</p>

  <p>As error is almost always partial truth, and so consists in the
  exaggeration or distortion of one verity by the suppression of another
  which qualifies and modifies the former, we may hope, by the synthesis of
  the truths contended for by various advocates, to arrive at the one
  conciliating reality.</p>

  <p>Signs of this conciliation are not wanting: opposite scientific views,
  opposite philosophical conceptions, and opposite religious beliefs, are
  rapidly tending by their vigorous conflict to evolve such a systematic
  and comprehensive view of the genesis of species as will completely
  harmonize with the teachings of science, philosophy, and religion.</p>

  <p>To endeavour to add one stone to this temple of concord, to try and
  remove a few of the misconceptions and mutual misunderstandings which
  oppose harmonious action, is the aim and endeavour of the present work.
  This aim it is hoped to attain, not by shirking difficulties, but
  analysing them, and by endeavouring to dig down to the common root which
  supports and unites diverging stems of truth.</p>

  <p>It cannot but be a gain when the labourers in the three fields above
  mentioned, namely, science, philosophy, and religion, shall fully
  recognize this harmony. Then the energy too often spent in futile
  controversy, or withheld through prejudice, may be profitably and
  reciprocally exercised for the mutual benefit of all.</p>

  <p>Remarkable is the rapidity with which an interest in the question of
  specific origination has spread. But a few years ago it scarcely occupied
  the minds of any but naturalists. Then the crude theory put forth by
  Lamarck, and by his English interpreter the author of the "Vestiges of
  Creation," had rather discredited than helped on a belief in organic
  evolution&mdash;a belief, <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>[4]</span>that is, in new kinds being produced from
  older ones by the ordinary and constant operation of natural laws. Now,
  however, this belief is widely diffused. Indeed, there are few
  drawing-rooms where it is not the subject of occasional discussion, and
  artisans and schoolboys have their views as to the permanence of organic
  forms. Moreover, the reception of this doctrine tends actually, though by
  no means necessarily, to be accompanied by certain beliefs with regard to
  quite distinct and very momentous subject-matter. So that the question of
  the "Genesis of Species" is not only one of great interest, but also of
  much importance.</p>

  <p>But though the calm and thorough consideration of this matter is at
  the present moment exceedingly desirable, yet the actual importance of
  the question itself as to its consequences in the domain of theology has
  been strangely exaggerated by many, both of its opponents and supporters.
  This is especially the case with that form of the evolution theory which
  is associated with the name of Mr. Darwin; and yet neither the refutation
  nor the demonstration of that doctrine would be necessarily accompanied
  by the results which are hoped for by one party and dreaded by
  another.</p>

  <p>The general theory of evolution has indeed for some time past steadily
  gained ground, and it may be safely predicted that the number of facts
  which can be brought forward in its support will, in a few years, be
  vastly augmented. But the prevalence of this theory need alarm no one,
  for it is, without any doubt, perfectly consistent with strictest and
  most orthodox Christian theology. Moreover, it is not altogether without
  obscurities, and cannot yet be considered as fully demonstrated.</p>

  <p>The special Darwinian hypothesis, however, is beset with certain
  scientific difficulties, which must by no means be ignored, and some of
  which, I venture to think, are absolutely insuperable. What Darwinism or
  "Natural Selection" is, will <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>[5]</span>be shortly explained; but before doing so, I
  think it well to state the object of this book, and the view taken up and
  defended in it. It is its object to maintain the position that "Natural
  Selection" acts, and indeed must act, but that still, in order that we
  may be able to account for the production of known kinds of animals and
  plants, it requires to be supplemented by the action of some other
  natural law or laws as yet undiscovered.<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Also, that the consequences which have
  been drawn from Evolution, whether exclusively Darwinian or not, to the
  prejudice of religion, by no means follow from it, and are in fact
  illegitimate.</p>

  <p>The Darwinian theory of "Natural Selection" may be shortly stated
  thus:<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

  <p>Every kind of animal and plant tends to increase in numbers in a
  geometrical progression.</p>

  <p>Every kind of animal and plant transmits a general likeness, with
  individual differences, to its offspring.</p>

  <p>Every individual may present minute variations of any kind and in any
  direction.</p>

  <p>Past time has been practically infinite.</p>

  <p>Every individual has to endure a very severe struggle for existence,
  owing to the tendency to geometrical increase of all kinds of animals and
  plants, while the total animal and vegetable population (man and his
  agency excepted) remains almost stationary.</p>

  <p>Thus, every variation of a kind tending to save the life of the
  individual possessing it, or to enable it more surely to propagate its
  kind, will in the long run be preserved, and will transmit its favourable
  peculiarity to some of its offspring, <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span>which peculiarity will thus
  become intensified till it reaches the maximum degree of utility. On the
  other hand, individuals presenting unfavourable peculiarities will be
  ruthlessly destroyed. The action of this law of Natural Selection may
  thus be well represented by the convenient expression "survival of the
  fittest."<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now this conception of Mr. Darwin's is perhaps the most interesting
  theory, in relation to natural science, which has been promulgated during
  the present century. Remarkable, indeed, is the way in which it groups
  together such a vast and varied series of biological<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> facts, and even paradoxes, which it
  appears more or less clearly to explain, as the following instances will
  show. By this theory of "Natural Selection," light is thrown on the more
  singular facts relating to the geographical distribution of animals and
  plants; for example, on the resemblance between the past and present
  inhabitants of different parts of the earth's surface. Thus in Australia
  remains have been found of creatures closely allied to kangaroos and
  other kinds of pouched beasts, which in the present day exist nowhere but
  in the Australian region. Similarly in South America, and nowhere else,
  are found sloths and armadillos, and in that same part of the world have
  been discovered bones of animals different indeed from existing sloths
  and armadillos, but yet much more nearly related to them than to any
  other kinds whatever. Such coincidences between the existing and
  antecedent geographical distribution of forms are numerous. Again,
  "Natural Selection" serves to explain the circumstance that often in
  adjacent islands we find animals closely resembling, and appearing to
  represent, each other; while if certain of these islands show signs (by
  depth of surrounding sea or what not) of more ancient separation, the
  <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>[7]</span>animals inhabiting them exhibit a
  corresponding divergence.<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  The explanation consists in representing the forms inhabiting the islands
  as being the modified descendants of a common stock, the modification
  being greatest where the separation has been the most prolonged.</p>

  <p>"Rudimentary structures" also receive an explanation by means of this
  theory. These structures are parts which are apparently functionless and
  useless where they occur, but which represent similar parts of large size
  and functional importance in other animals. Examples of such "rudimentary
  structures" are the f&oelig;tal teeth of whales, and of the front part of
  the jaw of ruminating quadrupeds. These f&oelig;tal structures are minute
  in size, and never cut the gum, but are reabsorbed without ever coming
  into use, while no other teeth succeed them or represent them in the
  adult condition of those animals. The mammary glands of all male beasts
  constitute another example, as also does the wing of the apteryx&mdash;a
  New Zealand bird utterly incapable of flight, and with the wing in a
  quite rudimentary condition (whence the name of the animal). Yet this
  rudimentary wing contains bones which are miniature representatives of
  the ordinary wing-bones of birds of flight. Now, the presence of these
  useless bones and teeth is explained if they may be considered as
  actually being the inherited diminished representatives of parts of large
  size and functional importance in the remote ancestors of these various
  animals.</p>

  <p>Again, the singular facts of "homology" are capable of a similar
  explanation. "Homology" is the name applied to the investigation of those
  profound resemblances which have so often been found to underlie
  superficial differences between animals of very different form and habit.
  Thus man, the horse, the whale, and the bat, all have the pectoral limb,
  whether it be the arm, or fore-leg, or paddle, or wing, formed on
  essentially the same type, though <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[8]</span>the number and proportion of parts may more or
  less differ. Again, the butterfly and the shrimp, different as they are
  in appearance and mode of life, are yet constructed on the same common
  plan, of which they constitute diverging manifestations. No <i>a
  priori</i> reason is conceivable why such similarities should be
  necessary, but they are readily explicable on the assumption of a genetic
  relationship and affinity between the animals in question, assuming, that
  is, that they are the modified descendants of some ancient
  form&mdash;their common ancestor.</p>

  <p>That remarkable series of changes which animals undergo before they
  attain their adult condition, which is called their process of
  development, and during which they more or less closely resemble other
  animals during the early stages of the same process, has also great light
  thrown on it from the same source. The question as to the singularly
  complex resemblances borne by every adult animal and plant to a certain
  number of other animals and plants&mdash;resemblances by means of which
  the adopted zoological and botanical systems of classification have been
  possible&mdash;finds its solution in a similar manner, classification
  becoming the expression of a genealogical relationship. Finally, by this
  theory&mdash;and as yet by this alone&mdash;can any explanation be given
  of that extraordinary phenomenon which is metaphorically termed
  <i>mimicry</i>. Mimicry is a close and striking, yet superficial
  resemblance borne by some animal or plant to some other, perhaps very
  different, animal or plant. The "walking leaf" (an insect belonging to
  the grasshopper and cricket order) is a well-known and conspicuous
  instance of the assumption by an animal of the appearance of a vegetable
  structure (see illustration on p. 35); and the bee, fly, and spider
  orchids are familiar examples of a converse resemblance. Birds,
  butterflies, reptiles, and even fish, seem to bear in certain instances a
  similarly striking resemblance to other birds, butterflies, reptiles, and
  fish, of altogether distinct kinds. The explanation of this matter which
  "Natural Selection" offers, as <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>[9]</span>to animals, is that certain varieties of one
  kind have found exemption from persecution in consequence of an
  accidental resemblance which such varieties have exhibited to animals of
  another kind, or to plants; and that they were thus preserved, and the
  degree of resemblance was continually augmented in their descendants. As
  to plants, the explanation offered by this theory might perhaps be that
  varieties of plants which presented a certain superficial resemblance in
  their flowers to insects, have thereby been helped to propagate their
  kind, the visit of certain insects being useful or indispensable to the
  fertilization of many flowers.</p>

  <p>We have thus a whole series of important facts which "Natural
  Selection" helps us to understand and co-ordinate. And not only are all
  these diverse facts strung together, as it were, by the theory in
  question; not only does it explain the development of the complex
  instincts of the beaver, the cuckoo, the bee, and the ant, as also the
  dazzling brilliancy of the humming-bird, the glowing tail and neck of the
  peacock, and the melody of the nightingale; the perfume of the rose and
  the violet, the brilliancy of the tulip and the sweetness of the nectar
  of flowers; not only does it help us to understand all these, but serves
  as a basis of future research and of inference from the known to the
  unknown, and it guides the investigator to the discovery of new facts
  which, when ascertained, it seems also able to co-ordinate.<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Nay, "Natural Selection"
  seems capable of application not only to the building up of the smallest
  and most insignificant organisms, but even of extension beyond the
  biological domain altogether, so as possibly to have relation to <!--
  Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span>the
  stable equilibrium of the solar system itself, and even of the whole
  sidereal universe. Thus, whether this theory be true or false, all lovers
  of natural science should acknowledge a deep debt of gratitude to Messrs.
  Darwin and Wallace, on account of its practical utility. But the utility
  of a theory by no means implies its truth. What do we not owe, for
  example, to the labours of the Alchemists? The emission theory of light,
  again, has been pregnant with valuable results, as still is the Atomic
  theory, and others which will readily suggest themselves.</p>

  <p>With regard to Mr. Darwin (with whose name, on account of the noble
  self-abnegation of Mr. Wallace, the theory is in general exclusively
  associated), his friends may heartily congratulate him on the fact that
  he is one of the few exceptions to the rule respecting the
  non-appreciation of a prophet in his own country. It would be difficult
  to name another living labourer in the field of physical science who has
  excited an interest so widespread, and given rise to so much praise,
  gathering round him, as he has done, a chorus of more or less completely
  acquiescing disciples, themselves masters in science, and each the
  representative of a crowd of enthusiastic followers.</p>

  <p>Such is the Darwinian theory of "Natural Selection," such are the more
  remarkable facts which it is potent to explain, and such is the reception
  it has met with in the world. A few words now as to the reasons for the
  very widespread interest it has awakened, and the keenness with which the
  theory has been both advocated and combated.</p>

  <p>The important bearing it has on such an extensive range of scientific
  facts, its utility, and the vast knowledge and great ingenuity of its
  promulgator, are enough to account for the heartiness of its reception by
  those learned in natural history. But quite other causes have concurred
  to produce the general and higher degree of interest felt in the theory
  beside the readiness with which it harmonizes with biological facts.
  These latter could only be appreciated by physiologists, zoologists, and
  botanists; whereas <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>[11]</span>the Darwinian theory, so novel and so
  startling, has found a cloud of advocates and opponents beyond and
  outside the world of physical science.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it was inevitable that a great crowd of
  half-educated men and shallow thinkers should accept with eagerness the
  theory of "Natural Selection," or rather what they think to be such (for
  few things are more remarkable than the way in which it has been
  misunderstood), on account of a certain characteristic it has in common
  with other theories; which should not be mentioned in the same breath
  with it, except, as now, with the accompaniment of protest and apology.
  We refer to its remarkable simplicity, and the ready way in which
  phenomena the most complex appear explicable by a cause for the
  comprehension of which laborious and persevering efforts are not
  required, but which may be represented by the simple phrase "survival of
  the fittest." With nothing more than this, can, on the Darwinian theory,
  all the most intricate facts of distribution and affinity, form, and
  colour, be accounted for; as well the most complex instincts and the most
  admirable adjustments, such as those of the human eye and ear. It is in
  great measure then, owing to this supposed simplicity, and to a belief in
  its being yet easier and more simple than it is, that Darwinism, however
  imperfectly understood, has become a subject for general conversation,
  and has been able thus widely to increase a certain knowledge of
  biological matters; and this excitation of interest in quarters where
  otherwise it would have been entirely wanting, is an additional motive
  for gratitude on the part of naturalists to the authors of the new
  theory. At the same time it must be admitted that a similar
  "simplicity"&mdash;the apparently easy explanation of complex
  phenomena&mdash;also constitutes the charm of such matters as hydropathy
  and phrenology, in the eyes of the unlearned or half-educated public. It
  is indeed <i>the</i> charm of all those seeming "short cuts" to
  knowledge, by which the labour of mastering scientific details is <!--
  Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[12]</span>spared
  to those who yet believe that without such labour they can attain all the
  most valuable results of scientific research. It is not, of course, for a
  moment meant to imply that its "simplicity" tells at all against "Natural
  Selection," but only that the actual or supposed possession of that
  quality is a strong reason for the wide and somewhat hasty acceptance of
  the theory, whether it be true or not.</p>

  <p>In the second place, it was inevitable that a theory appearing to have
  very grave relations with questions of the last importance and interest
  to man, that is, with questions of religious belief, should call up an
  army of assailants and defenders. Nor have the supporters of the theory
  much reason, in many cases, to blame the more or less unskilful and hasty
  attacks of adversaries, seeing that those attacks have been in great part
  due to the unskilful and perverse advocacy of the cause on the part of
  some of its adherents. If the <i>odium theologicum</i> has inspired some
  of its opponents, it is undeniable that the <i>odium antitheologicum</i>
  has possessed not a few of its supporters. It is true (and in
  appreciating some of Mr. Darwin's expressions it should never be
  forgotten) that the theory has been both at its first promulgation and
  since vehemently attacked and denounced as unchristian, nay, as
  necessarily atheistic; but it is not less true that it has been made use
  of as a weapon of offence by irreligious writers, and has been again and
  again, especially in continental Europe, thrown, as it were, in the face
  of believers, with sneers and contumely. When we recollect the warmth
  with which what he thought was Darwinism was advocated by such a writer
  as Professor Vogt, one cause of his zeal was not far to seek&mdash;a
  zeal, by the way, certainly not "according to knowledge;" for few
  conceptions could have been more conflicting with true Darwinism than the
  theory he formerly maintained, but has since abandoned, viz. that the men
  of the Old World were descended from African and Asiatic apes, while,
  similarly, the American apes were the progenitors of the human beings of
  the New World. <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>[13]</span>The cause of this palpable error in a too
  eager disciple one might hope was not anxiety to snatch up all or any
  arms available against Christianity, were it not for the tone unhappily
  adopted by this author. But it is unfortunately quite impossible to
  mistake his meaning and intention, for he is a writer whose offensiveness
  is gross, while it is sometimes almost surpassed by an amazing
  shallowness. Of course, as might fully be expected, he adopts and
  reproduces the absurdly trivial objections to absolute morality drawn
  from differences in national customs.<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> And he seems to have as little conception
  of the distinction between "formally" moral actions and those which are
  only "materially" moral, as of that between the <i>verbum mentale</i> and
  the <i>verbum oris</i>. As an example of his onesidedness, it may be
  remarked that he compares the skulls of the American monkeys (<i>Cebus
  apella</i> and <i>C. albifrons</i>) with the intention of showing that
  man is of several distinct species, because skulls of different men are
  less alike than are those of these two monkeys; and he does this
  regardless of how the skulls of domestic animals (with which it is far
  more legitimate to compare races of men than with wild kinds),
  <i>e.g.</i> of different dogs or pigeons, tell precisely in the opposite
  direction. Regardless also of the fact that perhaps no genus of monkeys
  is in a more unsatisfactory state as to the determination of its
  different kinds than the genus chosen by him for illustration. This is so
  much the case that J. A. Wagner (in his supplement to Schreber's great
  work on Beasts) at first included all the kinds in a single species.</p>

  <p>As to the strength of his prejudice and his regretable coarseness, one
  quotation will be enough to display both. Speaking of certain early
  Christian missionaries, he says,<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> "It is not so very improbable that the
  new religion, before which the flourishing Roman civilization relapsed
  into a state of barbarism, should have <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>been introduced by people
  in whose skulls the anatomist finds simious characters so well developed,
  and in which the phrenologist finds the organ of veneration so much
  enlarged. I shall, in the meanwhile, call these simious narrow skulls of
  Switzerland 'Apostle skulls,' as I imagine that in life they must have
  resembled the type of Peter, the Apostle, as represented in
  Byzantine-Nazarene art."</p>

  <p>In face of such a spirit, can it be wondered at that disputants have
  grown warm? Moreover, in estimating the vehemence of the opposition which
  has been offered, it should be borne in mind that the views defended by
  religious writers are, or should be, all-important in their eyes. They
  could not be expected to view with equanimity the destruction in many
  minds of "theology, natural and revealed, psychology, and metaphysics;"
  nor to weigh with calm and frigid impartiality arguments which seemed to
  them to be fraught with results of the highest moment to mankind, and,
  therefore, imposing on their consciences strenuous opposition as a first
  duty. Cool judicial impartiality in them would have been a sign perhaps
  of intellectual gifts, but also of a more important deficiency of
  generous emotion.</p>

  <p>It is easy to complain of the onesidedness of many of those who oppose
  Darwinism in the interest of orthodoxy; but not at all less patent is the
  intolerance and narrow-mindedness of some of those who advocate it,
  avowedly or covertly, in the interest of heterodoxy. This hastiness of
  rejection or acceptance, determined by ulterior consequences believed to
  attach to "Natural Selection," is unfortunately in part to be accounted
  for by some expressions and a certain tone to be found in Mr. Darwin's
  writings. That his expressions, however, are not always to be construed
  literally is manifest. His frequent use metaphorically of the
  expressions, "contrivance," for example, and "purpose," has elicited,
  from the Duke of Argyll and others, criticisms which fail to tell against
  their <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>[15]</span>opponent, because such expressions are, in
  Mr. Darwin's writings, merely figurative&mdash;metaphors, and nothing
  more.</p>

  <p>It may be hoped, then, that a similar looseness of expression will
  account for passages of a directly opposite tendency to that of his
  theistic metaphors.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it must not be forgotten that he frequently uses that
  absolutely theological term, "the Creator," and that he has retained in
  all the editions of his "Origin of Species" an expression which has been
  much criticised. He speaks "of life, with its several powers, having been
  originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms, or into one."<a
  name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> This is merely mentioned in
  justice to Mr. Darwin, and by no means because it is a position which
  this book is intended to support. For, from Mr. Darwin's usual mode of
  speaking, it appears that by such divine action he means a supernatural
  intervention, whereas it is here contended that throughout the whole
  process of physical evolution&mdash;the first manifestation of life
  included&mdash;<i>supernatural</i> action is assuredly not to be looked
  for.</p>

  <p>Again, in justice to Mr. Darwin, it may be observed that he is
  addressing the general public, and opposing the ordinary and common
  objections of popular religionists, who have inveighed against
  "Evolution" and "Natural Selection" as atheistic, impious, and directly
  conflicting with the dogma of creation.</p>

  <p>Still, in so important a matter, it is to be regretted that he did not
  take the trouble to distinguish between such merely popular views and
  those which repose upon some more venerable authority. Mr. John Stuart
  Mill has replied to similar critics, and shown that the assertion that
  his philosophy is irreconcilable with theism is unfounded; and it would
  have been better if Mr. Darwin had dealt in the same manner with some of
  his assailants, and shown the futility of certain of their <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span>objections when
  viewed from a more elevated religious standpoint. Instead of so doing, he
  seems to adopt the narrowest notions of his opponents, and, far from
  endeavouring to expand them, appears to wish to endorse them, and to lend
  to them the weight of his authority. It is thus that Mr. Darwin seems to
  admit and assume that the idea of "creation" necessitates a belief in an
  interference with, or dispensation of, natural laws, and that "creation"
  must be accompanied by arbitrary and unorderly phenomena. None but the
  crudest conceptions are placed by him to the credit of supporters of the
  dogma of creation, and it is constantly asserted that they, to be
  consistent, must offer "creative fiats" as explanations of physical
  phenomena, and be guilty of numerous other such absurdities. It is
  impossible, therefore, to acquit Mr. Darwin of at least a certain
  carelessness in this matter; and the result is, he has the appearance of
  opposing ideas which he gives no clear evidence of having ever fully
  appreciated. He is far from being alone in this, and perhaps merely takes
  up and reiterates, without much consideration, assertions previously
  assumed by others. Nothing could be further from Mr. Darwin's mind than
  any, however small, intentional misrepresentation; and it is therefore
  the more unfortunate that he should not have shown any appreciation of a
  position opposed to his own other than that gross and crude one which he
  combats so superfluously&mdash;that he should appear, even for a moment,
  to be one of those, of whom there are far too many, who first
  misrepresent their adversary's view, and then elaborately refute it; who,
  in fact, erect a doll utterly incapable of self-defence and then, with a
  flourish of trumpets and many vigorous strokes, overthrow the helpless
  dummy they had previously raised.</p>

  <p>This is what many do who more or less distinctly oppose theism in the
  interests, as they believe, of physical science; and they often
  represent, amongst other things, a gross and narrow anthropomorphism as
  the necessary consequence of views <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[17]</span>opposed to those which
  they themselves advocate. Mr. Darwin and others may perhaps be excused if
  they have not devoted much time to the study of Christian philosophy; but
  they have no right to assume or accept, without careful examination, as
  an unquestioned fact, that in that philosophy there is a necessary
  antagonism between the two ideas, "creation" and "evolution," as applied
  to organic forms.</p>

  <p>It is notorious and patent to all who choose to seek, that many
  distinguished Christian thinkers have accepted and do accept both ideas,
  <i>i.e.</i> both "creation" and "evolution."</p>

  <p>As much as ten years ago, an eminently Christian writer observed: "The
  creationist theory does not necessitate the perpetual search after
  manifestations of miraculous powers and perpetual 'catastrophes.'
  Creation is not a miraculous interference with the laws of nature, but
  the very institution of those laws. Law and regularity, not arbitrary
  intervention, was the patristic ideal of creation. With this notion, they
  admitted without difficulty the most surprising origin of living
  creatures, provided it took place by <i>law</i>. They held that when God
  said, 'Let the waters produce,' 'Let the earth produce,' He conferred
  forces on the elements of earth and water, which enabled them naturally
  to produce the various species of organic beings. This power, they
  thought, remains attached to the elements throughout all time."<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The same writer quotes
  St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, to the effect that, "in the
  institution of nature we do not look for miracles, but for the laws of
  nature."<a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> And, again,
  St. Basil,<a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> speaks of
  the continued operation of natural laws in the production of all
  organisms. <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>[18]</span></p>

  <p>So much for writers of early and mediæval times. As to the present
  day, the Author can confidently affirm that there are many as well versed
  in theology as Mr. Darwin is in his own department of natural knowledge,
  who would not be disturbed by the thorough demonstration of his theory.
  Nay, they would not even be in the least painfully affected at witnessing
  the generation of animals of complex organization by the skilful
  artificial arrangement of natural forces, and the production, in the
  future, of a fish, by means analogous to those by which we now produce
  urea.</p>

  <p>And this because they know that the possibility of such phenomena,
  though by no means actually foreseen, has yet been fully provided for in
  the old philosophy centuries before Darwin, or even before Bacon, and
  that their place in the system can be at once assigned them without even
  disturbing its order or marring its harmony.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the old tradition in this respect has never been abandoned,
  however much it may have been ignored or neglected by some modern
  writers. In proof of this it may be observed that perhaps no
  post-mediæval theologian has a wider reception amongst Christians
  throughout the world than Suarez, who has a separate section<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> in opposition to those
  who maintain the distinct creation of the various kinds&mdash;or
  substantial forms&mdash;of organic life.</p>

  <p>But the consideration of this matter must be deferred for the present,
  and the question of evolution, whether Darwinian or other, be first gone
  into. It is proposed, after that has been done, to return to this subject
  (here merely alluded to), and to consider at some length the bearing of
  "Evolution," whether Darwinian or non-Darwinian, upon "Creation and
  Theism."</p>

  <p>Now we will revert simply to the consideration of the theory of
  "Natural Selection" itself.</p>

<p><!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

  <p>Whatever may have hitherto been the amount of acceptance that this
  theory has met with, all, I think, anticipated that the appearance of Mr.
  Darwin's large and careful work on "Animals and Plants under
  Domestication" could but further increase that acceptance. It is,
  however, somewhat problematical how far such anticipations will be
  realized. The newer book seems to add after all but little in support of
  the theory, and to leave most, if not all, its difficulties exactly where
  they were. It is a question, also, whether the hypothesis of
  "Pangenesis"<a name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> may not be
  found rather to encumber than to support the theory it was intended to
  subserve. However, the work in question treats only of domestic animals,
  and probably the next instalment will address itself more vigorously and
  directly to the difficulties which seem to us yet to bar the way to a
  complete acceptance of the doctrine.</p>

  <p>If the theory of Natural Selection can be shown to be quite
  insufficient to explain any considerable number of important phenomena
  connected with the origin of species, that theory, as <i>the</i>
  explanation, must be considered as provisionally discredited.</p>

  <p>If other causes than Natural (including sexual) Selection can be
  proved to have acted&mdash;if variation can in any cases be proved to be
  subject to certain determinations in special directions by other means
  than Natural Selection, it then becomes probable <i>a priori</i> that it
  is so in others, and that Natural Selection <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span>depends upon, and only
  supplements, such means, which conception is opposed to the pure
  Darwinian position.</p>

  <p>Now it is certain, <i>a priori</i>, that variation is obedient to some
  law and therefore that "Natural Selection" itself must be capable of
  being subsumed into some higher law; and it is evident, I believe, <i>a
  posteriori</i>, that Natural Selection is, at the very least, aided and
  supplemented by some other agency.</p>

  <p>Admitting, then, organic and other evolution, and that new forms of
  animals and plants (new species, genera, &amp;c.) have from time to time
  been evolved from preceding animals and plants, it follows, if the views
  here advocated are true, that this evolution has not taken place by the
  action of "Natural Selection" <i>alone</i>, but through it (amongst other
  influences) aided by the concurrent action of some other natural law or
  laws, at present undiscovered; and probably that the genesis of species
  takes place partly, perhaps mainly, through laws which may be most
  conveniently spoken of as special powers and tendencies existing in each
  organism; and partly through influences exerted on each by surrounding
  conditions and agencies organic and inorganic, terrestrial and cosmical,
  among which the "survival of the fittest" plays a certain but subordinate
  part.</p>

  <p>The theory of "Natural Selection" may (though it need not) be taken in
  such a way as to lead men to regard the present organic world as formed,
  so to speak, <i>accidentally</i>, beautiful and wonderful as is
  confessedly the hap-hazard result. The same may perhaps be said with
  regard to the system advocated by Mr. Herbert Spencer, who, however, also
  relegates "Natural Selection" to a subordinate <i>rôle</i>. The view here
  advocated, on the other hand, regards the whole organic world as arising
  and going forward in one harmonious development similar to that which
  displays itself in the growth and action of each separate individual
  organism. It also regards each such separate <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[21]</span>organism as the
  expression of powers and tendencies not to be accounted for by "Natural
  Selection" alone, or even by that together with merely the direct
  influence of surrounding conditions.</p>

  <p>The difficulties which appear to oppose themselves to the reception of
  "Natural Selection" or "the survival of the fittest," as the one
  explanation of the origin of species, have no doubt been already
  considered by Mr. Darwin. Nevertheless, it may be worth while to
  enumerate them, and to state the considerations which appear to give them
  weight; and there is no doubt but that a naturalist so candid and careful
  as the author of the theory in question, will feel obliged, rather than
  the reverse, by the suggestion of all the doubts and difficulties which
  can be brought against it.</p>

  <p>What is to be brought forward may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>That "Natural Selection" is incompetent to account for the incipient
  stages of useful structures.</p>

  <p>That it does not harmonize with the co-existence of closely similar
  structures of diverse origin.</p>

  <p>That there are grounds for thinking that specific differences may be
  developed suddenly instead of gradually.</p>

  <p>That the opinion that species have definite though very different
  limits to their variability is still tenable.</p>

  <p>That certain fossil transitional forms are absent, which might have
  been expected to be present.</p>

  <p>That some facts of geographical distribution supplement other
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>That the objection drawn from the physiological difference between
  "species" and "races" still exists unrefuted.</p>

  <p>That there are many remarkable phenomena in organic forms upon which
  "Natural Selection" throws no light whatever, but the explanations of
  which, if they could be attained, might throw light upon specific
  origination. <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>[22]</span></p>

  <p>Besides these objections to the sufficiency of "Natural Selection,"
  others may be brought against the hypothesis of "Pangenesis," which,
  professing as it does to explain great difficulties, seems to do so by
  presenting others not less great&mdash;almost to be the explanation of
  <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>. <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE INCOMPETENCY OF "NATURAL SELECTION" TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INCIPIENT STAGES OF USEFUL STRUCTURES.</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Mr. Darwin supposes that natural selection acts by slight
  variations.&mdash;These must be useful at once.&mdash;Difficulties as to
  the giraffe; as to mimicry; as to the heads of flat-fishes; as to the
  origin and constancy of the vertebrate limbs; as to whalebone; as to the
  young kangaroo; as to sea-urchins; as to certain processes of
  metamorphosis; as to the mammary gland; as to certain ape characters; as
  to the rattlesnake and cobra; as to the process of formation of the eye
  and ear; as to the fully developed condition of the eye and ear; as to
  the voice; as to shell-fish; as to orchids; as to ants.&mdash;The
  necessity for the simultaneous modification of many
  individuals.&mdash;Summary and conclusion.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Natural Selection," simply and by itself, is potent to explain the
  maintenance or the further extension and development of favourable
  variations, which are at once sufficiently considerable to be useful from
  the first to the individual possessing them. But Natural Selection
  utterly fails to account for the conservation and development of the
  minute and rudimentary beginnings, the slight and infinitesimal
  commencements of structures, however useful those structures may
  afterwards become.</p>

  <p>Now, it is distinctly enunciated by Mr. Darwin, that the spontaneous
  variations upon which his theory depends are individually slight, minute,
  and insensible. He says,<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> "Slight <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span>individual differences,
  however, suffice for the work, and are probably the sole differences
  which are effective in the production of new species." And again, after
  mentioning the frequent sudden appearances of domestic varieties, he
  speaks of "the false belief as to the similarity of natural species in
  this respect."<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> In his
  work on the "Origin of Species," he also observes, "Natural Selection
  acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small inherited
  modifications."<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> And
  "Natural Selection, if it be a true principle, will banish the belief ...
  of any great and sudden modification in their structure."<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Finally, he adds, "If it could be
  demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly
  have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory
  would absolutely break down."<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now the conservation of minute variations in many instances is, of
  course, plain and intelligible enough; such, <i>e.g.</i>, as those which
  tend to promote the destructive faculties of beasts of prey on the one
  hand, or to facilitate the flight or concealment of the animals pursued
  on the other; provided always that these minute beginnings are of such a
  kind as really to have a certain efficiency, however small, in favour of
  the conservation of the individual possessing them; and also provided
  that no unfavourable peculiarity in any other direction accompanies and
  neutralizes, in the struggle for life, the minute favourable
  variation.</p>

  <p>But some of the cases which have been brought forward, and which have
  met with very general acceptance, seem less satisfactory when carefully
  analysed than they at first appear to be. Amongst these we may mention
  "the neck of the giraffe."</p>

  <p>At first sight it would seem as though a better example in support of
  "Natural Selection" could hardly have been chosen. <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>Let the fact of the
  occurrence of occasional, severe droughts in the country which that
  animal has inhabited be granted. In that case, when the ground vegetation
  has been consumed, and the trees alone remain, it is plain that at such
  times only those individuals (of what we assume to be the nascent giraffe
  species) which were able to reach high up would be preserved, and would
  become the parents of the following generation, some individuals of which
  would, of course, inherit that high-reaching power which alone preserved
  their parents. Only the high-reaching issue of these high-reaching
  individuals would again, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, be preserved at the next
  drought, and would again transmit to their offspring their still loftier
  stature; and so on, from period to period, through æons of time, all the
  individuals tending to revert to the ancient shorter type of body, being
  ruthlessly destroyed at the occurrence of each drought.</p>

  <p>(1.) But against this it may be said, in the first place, that the
  argument proves too much; for, on this supposition, many species must
  have tended to undergo a similar modification, and we ought to have at
  least several forms, similar to the giraffe, developed from different
  Ungulata.<a name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> A careful
  observer of animal life, who has long resided in South Africa, explored
  the interior, and lived in the giraffe country, has assured the Author
  that the giraffe has powers of locomotion and endurance fully equal to
  those possessed by any of the other Ungulata of that continent. It would
  seem, therefore, that some of these other Ungulates ought to have
  developed in a similar manner as to the neck, under pain of being
  starved, when the long neck of the giraffe was in its incipient
  stage.</p>

  <p>To this criticism it has been objected that different kinds of animals
  are preserved, in the struggle for life, in very different <!-- Page 26
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[26]</span>ways, and even
  that "high reaching" may be attained in more modes than one&mdash;as, for
  example, by the trunk of the elephant. This is, indeed, true, but then
  none of the African Ungulata<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> have, nor do they appear ever to have
  had, any proboscis whatsoever; nor have they acquired such a development
  as to allow them to rise on their hind limbs and graze on trees in a
  kangaroo-attitude, nor a power of climbing, nor, as far as known, any
  other modification tending to compensate for the comparative shortness of
  the neck. Again, it may perhaps be said that leaf-eating forms are
  exceptional, and that therefore the struggle to attain high branches
  would not affect many Ungulates. But surely, when these severe droughts
  necessary for the theory occur, the ground vegetation is supposed to be
  exhausted; and, indeed, the giraffe is quite capable of feeding from off
  the ground. So that, in these cases, the other Ungulata <i>must</i> have
  taken to leaf eating or have starved, and thus must have had any
  accidental long-necked varieties favoured and preserved exactly as the
  long-necked varieties of the giraffe are supposed to have been favoured
  and preserved.</p>

  <p>The argument as to the different modes of preservation has been very
  well put by Mr. Wallace,<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> in reply to the objection that "colour,
  being dangerous, should not exist in nature." This objection appears
  similar to mine; as I say that a giraffe neck, being needful, there
  should be many animals with it, while the objector noticed by Mr. Wallace
  says, "a dull colour being needful, all animals should be so coloured."
  And Mr. Wallace shows in reply how porcupines, tortoises and mussels,
  very hard-coated bombadier beetles, stinging insects and nauseous-tasted
  caterpillars, can afford to be brilliant by the various means of active
  defence or passive protection <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span>they possess, other than obscure
  colouration. He says "the attitudes of some insects may also protect
  them, as the habit of turning up the tail by the harmless rove-beetles
  (Staphylinidæ) no doubt leads other animals, besides children, to the
  belief that they can sting. The curious attitude assumed by sphinx
  caterpillars is probably a safeguard, as well as the blood-red tentacles
  which can suddenly be thrown out from the neck by the caterpillars of all
  the true swallow-tailed butterflies."</p>

  <p>But, because many different kinds of animals can elude the observation
  or defy the attack of enemies in a great variety of ways, it by no means
  follows that there are any similar number and variety of ways for
  attaining vegetable food in a country where all such food, other than the
  lofty branches of trees, has been for a time destroyed. In such a country
  we have a number of vegetable-feeding Ungulates, all of which present
  minute variations as to the length of the neck. If, as Mr. Darwin
  contends, the natural selection of these favourable variations has alone
  lengthened the neck of the giraffe by preserving it during droughts;
  similar variations, in similarly-feeding forms, at the same times, ought
  similarly to have been preserved and so lengthened the neck of some other
  Ungulates by similarly preserving them during the same droughts.</p>

  <p>(2.) It may be also objected, that the power of reaching upwards,
  acquired by the lengthening of the neck and legs, must have necessitated
  a considerable increase in the entire size and mass of the body (larger
  bones requiring stronger and more voluminous muscles and tendons, and
  these again necessitating larger nerves, more capacious blood-vessels,
  &amp;c.), and it is very problematical whether the disadvantages thence
  arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than counterbalance the
  advantages.</p>

  <p>For a considerable increase in the supply of food would be requisite
  on account of this increase in size and mass, while at the same time
  there would be a certain decrease in strength; <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>for, as Mr. Herbert
  Spencer says,<a name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> "It is
  demonstrable that the excess of absorbed over expended nutriment must,
  other things equal, become less as the size of an animal becomes greater.
  In similarly-shaped bodies, the masses vary as the cubes of the
  dimensions; whereas the strengths vary as the squares of the
  dimensions.".... "Supposing a creature which a year ago was one foot
  high, has now become two feet high, while it is unchanged in proportions
  and structure&mdash;what are the necessary concomitant changes that have
  taken place in it? It is eight times as heavy; that is to say, it has to
  resist eight times the strain which gravitation puts on its structure;
  and in producing, as well as in arresting, every one of its movements, it
  has to overcome eight times the inertia. Meanwhile, the muscles and bones
  have severally increased their contractile and resisting powers, in
  proportion to the areas of their transverse sections; and hence are
  severally but four times as strong as they were. Thus, while the creature
  has doubled in height, and while its ability to overcome forces has
  quadrupled, the forces it has to overcome have grown eight times as
  great. Hence, to raise its body through a given space, its muscles have
  to be contracted with twice the intensity, at a double cost of matter
  expended." Again, as to the cost at which nutriment is distributed
  through the body, and effete matters removed from it, "Each increment of
  growth being added at the periphery of an organism, the force expended in
  the transfer of matter must increase in a rapid progression&mdash;a
  progression more rapid than that of the mass."</p>

  <p>There is yet another point. Vast as may have been the time during
  which the process of evolution has continued, it is nevertheless not
  infinite. Yet, as every kind, on the Darwinian hypothesis, varies
  slightly but indefinitely in every organ and every part of every organ,
  how very generally must favourable <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span>variations as to the
  length of the neck have been accompanied by some unfavourable variation
  in some other part, neutralizing the action of the favourable one, the
  latter, moreover, only taking effect during these periods of drought! How
  often must not individuals, favoured by a slightly increased length of
  neck, have failed to enjoy the elevated foliage which they had not
  strength or endurance to attain; while other individuals, exceptionally
  robust, could struggle on yet further till they arrived at vegetation
  within their reach.</p>

  <p>However, allowing this example to pass, many other instances will be
  found to present great difficulties.</p>

  <p>Let us take the cases of mimicry amongst lepidoptera and other
  insects. Of this subject Mr. Wallace has given a most interesting and
  complete account,<a name="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
  showing in how many and strange instances this superficial resemblance by
  one creature to some other quite distinct creature acts as a safeguard to
  the first. One or two instances must here suffice. In South America there
  is a family of butterflies, termed <i>Heliconidæ</i>, which are very
  conspicuously coloured and slow in flight, and yet the individuals abound
  in prodigious numbers, and take no precautions to conceal themselves,
  even when at rest, during the night. Mr. Bates (the author of the very
  interesting work "The Naturalist on the River Amazons," and the
  discoverer of "Mimicry") found that these conspicuous butterflies had a
  very strong and disagreeable odour; so much so that any one handling them
  and squeezing them, as a collector must do, has his fingers stained and
  so infected by the smell, as to require time and much trouble to remove
  it.</p>

  <p>It is suggested that this unpleasant quality is the cause of the
  abundance of the Heliconidæ; Mr. Bates and other observers reporting that
  they have never seen them attacked by the birds, reptiles, or insects
  which prey upon other lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>Now it is a curious fact that very different South American <!-- Page
  30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span>butterflies
  put on, as it were, the exact dress of these offensive beauties and mimic
  them even in their mode of flight.</p>

  <p>In explaining the mode of action of this protecting resemblance Mr.
  Wallace observes:<a name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
  "Tropical insectivorous birds very frequently sit on dead branches of a
  lofty tree, or on those which overhang forest paths, gazing intently
  around, and darting off at intervals to seize an insect at a considerable
  distance, with which they generally return to their station to devour. If
  a bird began by capturing the slow-flying conspicuous Heliconidæ, and
  found them always so disagreeable that it could not eat them, it would
  after a very few trials leave off catching them at all; and their whole
  appearance, form, colouring, and mode of flight is so peculiar, that
  there can be little doubt birds would soon learn to distinguish them at a
  long distance, and never waste any time in pursuit of them. Under these
  circumstances, it is evident that any other butterfly of a group which
  birds were accustomed to devour, would be almost equally well protected
  by closely resembling a Heliconia externally, as if it acquired also the
  disagreeable odour; always supposing that there were only a few of them
  among a great number of Heliconias."</p>

  <p>"The approach in colour and form to the Heliconidæ, however, would be
  at the first a positive, though perhaps a slight, advantage; for although
  at short distances this variety would be easily distinguished and
  devoured, yet at a longer distance it might be mistaken for one of the
  uneatable group, and so be passed by and gain another day's life, which
  might in many cases be sufficient for it to lay a quantity of eggs and
  leave a numerous progeny, many of which would inherit the peculiarity
  which had been the safeguard of their parent."</p>

    LEAF BUTTERFLY IN FLIGHT AND REPOSE.<br /> (<i>From Mr. Wallace's</i>
    "<i>Malay Archipelago.</i>")
  </div>
  <p>As a complete example of mimicry Mr. Wallace refers to a common Indian
  butterfly. He says:<a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  "But the most wonderful and undoubted case of protective resemblance in a
  butterfly, <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>[31]</span>which I have ever seen, is that of the
  common Indian <i>Kallima inachis</i>, and its Malayan ally, <i>Kallima
  paralekta</i>. The upper surface of these is very striking and showy, as
  they are of a <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[32]</span>large size, and are adorned with a broad
  band of rich orange on a deep bluish ground. The under side is very
  variable in colour, so that out of fifty specimens no two can be found
  exactly alike, but every one of them will be of some shade of ash, or
  brown, or ochre, such as are found among dead, dry, or decaying leaves.
  The apex of the upper wings is produced into an acute point, a very
  common form in the leaves of tropical shrubs and trees, and the lower
  wings are also produced into a short narrow tail. Between these two
  points runs a dark curved line exactly representing the midrib of a leaf,
  and from this radiate on each side a few oblique lines, which serve to
  indicate the lateral veins of a leaf. These marks are more clearly seen
  on the outer portion of the base of the wings, and on the inner side
  towards the middle and apex, and it is very curious to observe how the
  usual marginal and transverse striæ of the group are here modified and
  strengthened so as to become adapted for an imitation of the venation of
  a leaf." ... "But this resemblance, close as it is, would be of little
  use if the habits of the insect did not accord with it. If the butterfly
  sat upon leaves or upon flowers, or opened its wings so as to expose the
  upper surface, or exposed and moved its head and antennæ as many other
  butterflies do, its disguise would be of little avail. We might be sure,
  however, from the analogy of many other cases, that the habits of the
  insect are such as still further to aid its deceptive garb; but we are
  not obliged to make any such supposition, since I myself had the good
  fortune to observe scores of <i>Kallima paralekta</i>, in Sumatra, and to
  capture many of them, and can vouch for the accuracy of the following
  details. These butterflies frequent dry forests, and fly very swiftly.
  They were seen to settle on a flower or a green leaf, but were many times
  lost sight of in a bush or tree of dead leaves. On such occasions they
  were generally searched for in vain, for while gazing intently at the
  very spot where one had disappeared, it would often suddenly dart out,
  and again vanish twenty or fifty yards <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span>further on. On one or two
  occasions the insect was detected reposing, and it could then be seen how
  completely it assimilates itself to the surrounding leaves. It sits on a
  nearly upright twig, the wings fitting closely back to back, concealing
  the antennæ and head, which are drawn up between their bases. The little
  tails of the hind wing touch the branch, and form a perfect stalk to the
  leaf, which is supported in its place by the claws of the middle pair of
  feet, which are slender and inconspicuous. The irregular outline of the
  wings gives exactly the perspective effect of a shrivelled leaf. We thus
  have size, colour, form, markings, and habits, all combining together to
  produce a disguise which may be said to be absolutely perfect; and the
  protection which it affords is sufficiently indicated by the abundance of
  the individuals that possess it."</p>

  <p>Beetles also imitate bees and wasps, as do some Lepidoptera; and
  objects the most bizarre and unexpected are simulated, such as dung and
  drops of dew. Some insects, called bamboo and walking-stick insects, have
  a most remarkable resemblance to pieces of bamboo, to twigs and branches.
  Of these latter insects Mr. Wallace says:<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> "Some of these are a foot long and as
  thick as one's finger, and their whole colouring, form, rugosity, and the
  arrangement of the head, legs, and antennæ, are such as to render them
  absolutely identical in appearance with dry sticks. They hang loosely
  about shrubs in the forest, and have the extraordinary habit of
  stretching out their legs unsymmetrically, so as to render the deception
  more complete." Now let us suppose that the ancestors of these various
  animals were all destitute of the very special protections they at
  present possess, as on the Darwinian hypothesis we must do. Let it also
  be conceded that small deviations from the antecedent colouring or form
  would tend to make some of their ancestors escape destruction by causing
  them more or less frequently to <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>be passed over, or mistaken by their
  persecutors. Yet the deviation must, as the event has shown, in each case
  be in some definite direction, whether it be towards some other animal or
  plant, or towards some dead or inorganic matter. But as, according to Mr.
  Darwin's theory, there is a constant tendency to indefinite variation,
  and as the minute incipient variations will be in <i>all directions</i>,
  they must tend to neutralize each other, and at first to form such
  unstable modifications that it is difficult, if not impossible, to see
  how such indefinite oscillations of infinitesimal beginnings can ever
  build up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or
  other object, for "Natural Selection" to seize upon and perpetuate. This
  difficulty is augmented when we consider&mdash;a point to be dwelt upon
  hereafter&mdash;how necessary it is that many individuals should be
  similarly modified simultaneously. This has been insisted on in an able
  article in the <i>North British Review</i> for June 1867, p. 286, and the
  consideration of the article has occasioned Mr. Darwin to make an
  important modification in his views.<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In these cases of mimicry it seems difficult indeed to imagine a
  reason why variations tending in an <i>infinitesimal degree</i> in any
  special direction should be preserved. All variations would be preserved
  which tended to obscure the perception of an animal by its enemies,
  whatever direction those variations might take, and the common
  preservation of conflicting tendencies would greatly favour their mutual
  neutralization and obliteration if we may rely on the many cases recently
  brought forward by Mr. Darwin with regard to domestic animals.</p>

    THE WALKING-LEAF INSECT.
  </div>
  <p>Mr. Darwin explains the imitation of some species by others more or
  less nearly allied to it, by the common origin of both the mimic and the
  mimicked species, and the consequent possession by both (according to the
  theory of "Pangenesis") of gemmules tending to reproduce ancestral
  characters, which characters the <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span>mimic must be assumed first to have lost and
  then to have recovered. Mr. Darwin says,<a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> "Varieties of one species frequently
  mimic distinct species, a fact in perfect harmony with the foregoing
  cases, and explicable <i>only on the theory of descent</i>." But this at
  the best is but a partial and very incomplete explanation. It is one,
  moreover, which Mr. Wallace does not accept.<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> It is very incomplete, because it has
  no bearing on some of the most striking cases, and of course Mr. Darwin
  does not pretend that it has. We should have to go back far indeed to
  reach the common ancestor of the mimicking walking-leaf <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[36]</span>insect and the
  real leaf it mimics, or the original progenitor of both the bamboo insect
  and the bamboo itself. As these last most remarkable cases have certainly
  nothing to do with heredity,<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> it is unwarrantable to make use of that
  explanation for other protective resemblances, seeing that its
  inapplicability, in certain instances, is so manifest.</p>

  <p>Again, at the other end of the process it is as difficult to account
  for the last touches of perfection in the mimicry. Some insects which
  imitate leaves extend the imitation even to the very injuries on those
  leaves made by the attacks of insects or of fungi. Thus, speaking of one
  of the walking-stick insects, Mr. Wallace says:<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> "One of these creatures obtained by
  myself in Borneo (<i>Ceroxylus laceratus</i>) was covered over with
  foliaceous excrescences of a clear olive-green colour, so as exactly to
  resemble a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia. The Dyak
  who brought it me assured me it was grown over with moss although alive,
  and it was only after a most minute examination that I could convince
  myself it was not so." Again, as to the leaf butterfly, he says:<a
  name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> "We come to a still more
  extraordinary part of the imitation, for we find representations of
  leaves in every stage of decay, variously blotched, and mildewed, and
  pierced with holes, and in many cases irregularly covered with powdery
  black dots, gathered into patches and spots, so closely resembling the
  various kinds of minute fungi that grow on dead leaves, that it is
  impossible to avoid thinking at first sight that the butterflies
  themselves have been attacked by real fungi."</p>

  <p>Here imitation has attained a development which seems utterly beyond
  the power of the mere "survival of the fittest" to produce. How this
  double mimicry can importantly aid in the struggle for life seems
  puzzling indeed, but much more so <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[37]</span>how the first faint
  beginnings of the imitation of such injuries in the leaf can be developed
  in the animal into such a complete representation of them&mdash;<i>a
  fortiori</i> how simultaneous and similar first beginnings of imitations
  of such injuries could ever have been developed in several individuals,
  out of utterly indifferent and indeterminate infinitesimal variations in
  all conceivable directions.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">

    PLEURONECTIDÆ, WITH THE PECULIARLY PLACED EYE IN DIFFERENT
    POSITIONS.<br /> (<i>From Dr. Traquair's paper in the "Transactions of
    the Linnean Society, 1865."</i>)
  </div>
  <p>Another instance which may be cited is the asymmetrical condition of
  the heads of the flat-fishes (Pleuronectidæ), such as the sole, the
  flounder, the brill, the turbot, &amp;c. In all these fishes the two
  eyes, which in the young are situated as usual one on each side, come to
  be placed, in the adult, both on the same side of the head. If this
  condition had appeared at once, if in the hypothetically fortunate common
  ancestor of these fishes an eye had suddenly become thus transferred,
  then the perpetuation of such a transformation by the action of "Natural
  Selection" is conceivable enough. Such sudden changes, however, are not
  those favoured by the Darwinian theory, and indeed the accidental
  occurrence of such a spontaneous transformation is hardly conceivable.
  But if this is not so, if the transit was <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[38]</span>gradual, then how such
  transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey towards the other
  side of the head could benefit the individual is indeed far from clear.
  It seems, even, that such an incipient transformation must rather have
  been injurious. Another point with regard to these flat-fishes is that
  they appear to be in all probability of recent origin&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
  geologically speaking. There is, of course, no great stress to be laid on
  the mere absence of their remains from the secondary strata, nevertheless
  that absence is noteworthy, seeing that existing fish families,
  <i>e.g.</i> sharks (Squalidæ), have been found abundantly even down so
  far as the carboniferous rocks, and traces of them in the Upper
  Silurian.</p>

  <p>Another difficulty seems to be the first formation of the limbs of the
  higher animals. The lowest Vertebrata<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> are perfectly limbless, and if, as most
  Darwinians would probably assume, the primeval vertebrate creature was
  also apodal, how are the preservation and development of the first
  rudiments of limbs to be accounted for&mdash;such rudiments being, on the
  hypothesis in question, infinitesimal and functionless?</p>

  <p>In reply to this it has been suggested that a mere flattening of the
  end of the body has been useful, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as we see in
  sea-snakes,<a name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> which may
  be the rudiment of a tail formed strictly to aid in swimming. Also that a
  mere <i>roughness</i> of the skin might be useful to a swimming animal by
  holding the water better, that thus minute processes might be selected
  and preserved, and that, in the same way, these might be gradually
  increased into limbs. But it is, to say the least, very questionable
  whether a roughness of the skin, or minute processes, would be <!-- Page
  39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span>useful to a
  swimming animal; the motion of which they would as much impede as aid,
  unless they were at once capable of a suitable and appropriate action,
  which is against the hypothesis. Again, the change from mere indefinite
  and accidental processes to two regular pairs of symmetrical limbs, as
  the result of merely fortuitous, favouring variations, is a step the
  feasibility of which hardly commends itself to the reason, seeing the
  very different positions assumed by the ventral fins in different fishes.
  If the above suggestion made in opposition to the views here asserted be
  true, then the general constancy of position of the limbs of vertebrata
  may be considered as due to the position assumed by the primitive
  rugosities from which those limbs were generated. Clearly only two pairs
  of rugosities were so preserved and developed, and all limbs (on this
  view) are descendants of the same two pairs, as all have so similar a
  fundamental structure. Yet we find in many fishes the pair of fins, which
  correspond to the hinder limbs of other animals, placed so far forwards
  as to be either on the same level with, or actually in front of, the
  normally anterior pair of limbs; and such fishes are from this
  circumstance called "thoracic," or "jugular" fishes respectively, as the
  weaver fishes and the cod. This is a wonderful contrast to the fixity of
  position of vertebrate limbs generally. If then such a change can have
  taken place in the comparatively short time occupied by the evolution of
  these special fish forms, we might certainly expect other and far more
  bizarre structures would (did not some law forbid) have been developed,
  from other rugosities, in the manifold exigencies of the multitudinous
  organisms which must (on the Darwinian hypothesis) have been gradually
  evolved during the enormous period intervening between the first
  appearance of vertebrate life and the present day. Yet, with these
  exceptions, the position of the limbs is constant from the lower fishes
  up to man, there being always an anterior pectoral pair placed in front
  of a posterior or pelvic pair when both are <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[40]</span>present, and in no single
  instance are there more than these two pairs.</p>

      alt="Mouth of a whale." title="Mouth of a whale." /></a>
    MOUTH OF A WHALE.
  </div>
  <p>The development of whalebone (baleen) in the mouth of the whale is
  another difficulty. A whale's mouth is furnished with very numerous horny
  plates, which hang down from the palate along each side of the mouth.
  They thus form two longitudinal series, each plate of which is placed
  transversely to the long axis of the body, and all are very close
  together. On depressing the lower lip the free outer edges of these
  plates come into view. Their inner edges are furnished with numerous
  coarse hair-like processes, consisting of some of the constituent fibres
  of the horny plates&mdash;which, as it were, fray out&mdash;and the mouth
  is thus lined, except below, by a network of countless fibres formed by
  the inner edges of the two series of plates. This <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[41]</span>network acts as a sort of
  sieve. When the whale feeds it takes into its mouth a great gulp of
  water, which it drives out again through the intervals of the horny
  plates of baleen, the fluid thus traversing the sieve of horny fibres,
  which retains the minute creatures on which these marine monsters
  subsist. Now it is obvious, that if this baleen had once attained such a
  size and development as to be at all useful, then its preservation and
  augmentation within serviceable limits, would be promoted by "Natural
  Selection" alone. But how to obtain the beginning of such useful
  development? There are indeed certain animals of exclusively aquatic
  habits (the dugong and manatee) which also possess more or less horn on
  the palate, and at first sight this might be taken as a mitigation of the
  difficulty; but it is not so, and the fact does not help us one step
  further along the road: for, in the first place, these latter animals
  differ so importantly in structure from whales and porpoises that they
  form an altogether distinct order, and cannot be thought to approximate
  to the whale's progenitors. They are vegetarians, the whales feed on
  animals; the former never have the ribs articulated in the mode in which
  they are in some of the latter; the <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[42]</span>former have pectoral
  mammæ, and the latter are provided with two inguinal mammary glands, and
  have the nostrils enlarged into blowers, which the former have not. The
  former thus constitute the order Sirenia, while the latter belong to the
  Cetacea. In the second place, the horny matter on the palates of the
  dugong and manatee has not, even initially, that "strainer" action, which
  is the characteristic function of the Cetacean "baleen."</p>

    DUGONG.
  </div>
  <p>There is another very curious structure, the origin or the
  disappearance of which it seems impossible to account for on the
  hypothesis of minute indefinite variations. It is that of the mouth of
  the young kangaroo. In all mammals, as in ourselves, the air-passage from
  the lungs opens in the floor of the mouth behind the tongue, and in front
  of the opening of the gullet, so that each particle of food as it is
  swallowed passes over the opening, but is prevented from falling into it
  (and thus causing death from choking) by the action of a small
  cartilaginous shield (the epiglottis), which at the right moment bends
  back and protects the orifice. Now the kangaroo is born in such an
  exceedingly imperfect and undeveloped condition, that it is quite unable
  to suck. The mother therefore places the minute blind and naked young
  upon the nipple, and then injects milk into it by means of a special
  muscular envelope of the mammary gland. Did no special provision exist,
  the young one must infallibly be choked by the intrusion of the milk into
  the windpipe. But there <i>is</i> a special provision. The larynx is so
  elongated that it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage,
  and is thus enabled to give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while
  the milk passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so
  safely attains the gullet behind it.</p>

  <p>Now, on the Darwinian hypothesis, either all mammals descended from
  marsupial progenitors, or else the marsupials, sprung from animals having
  in most respects the ordinary mammalian structure. <!-- Page 43 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>[43]</span></p>

  <p>On the first alternative, how did "Natural Selection" remove this (at
  least perfectly innocent and harmless) structure in almost all other
  mammals, and, having done so, again reproduce it in precisely those forms
  which alone require it, namely, the Cetacea? That such a harmless
  structure <i>need not</i> be removed any Darwinian must confess, since a
  structure exists in both the crocodiles and gavials, which enables the
  former to breathe themselves while drowning the prey which they hold in
  their mouths. On Mr. Darwin's hypothesis it could only have been
  developed where useful, therefore not in the gavials(!) which feed on
  fish, but which yet retain, as we might expect, this, in them superfluous
  but harmless formation.</p>

  <p>On the second alternative, how did the elongated larynx itself arise,
  seeing that if its development lagged behind that of the maternal
  structure, the young primeval kangaroo must be choked: while without the
  injecting power in the mother, it must be starved? The struggle by the
  sole action of which such a form was developed must indeed have been
  severe!</p>

    AN ECHINUS, OR SEA-URCHIN<br /> (The spines removed from

  </div>
  <p>The sea-urchins (Echinus) present us also with structures the origin
  of which it seems impossible to explain by the action <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[44]</span>of "Natural
  Selection" only. These lowly animals belong to that group of the
  star-fish class (Echinodermata), the species of which possess generally
  spheroidal bodies, built up of multitudinous calcareous plates, and
  constitute the order Echinoidea. They are also popularly known as
  sea-eggs. Utterly devoid of limbs, the locomotion of these creatures is
  effected by means of rows of small tubular suckers (which protrude
  through pores in the calcareous plates) and by moveable spines scattered
  over the body.</p>

      alt="Pedicellariæ." title="Pedicellariæ." /></a>
    <p class="poem">PEDICELLARIÆ. (Immensely enlarged.)</p>
  </div>
  <p>Besides these spines and suckers there are certain very peculiar
  structures, termed "Pedicellariæ." Each of these consists of a long
  slender stalk, ending in three short limbs&mdash;or rather jaws&mdash;the
  whole supported by a delicate internal skeleton. The three limbs (or
  jaws), which start from a common point at the end of the stalk, are in
  the constant habit of opening and closing together again with a snapping
  action, while the stalk itself sways about. The utility of these
  appendages is, even now, problematical. It may be that they remove from
  the surface of the animal's body foreign substances which would be
  prejudicial to it, and which it cannot otherwise get rid of. But granting
  this, what would be the utility of the <i>first rudimentary
  beginnings</i> of such structures, and how could such incipient buddings
  have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus? It is true that on
  Darwinian principles the ancestral form from which the sea-urchin
  developed was different, and must not be conceived merely as an Echinus
  devoid of pedicellariæ; but this makes the difficulty none the less. It
  is equally hard to imagine that the first rudiments of such structures
  could have been useful to <i>any</i> animal <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[45]</span>from which the Echinus
  might have been derived. Moreover, not even the <i>sudden</i> development
  of the snapping action could have been beneficial without the freely
  moveable stalk, nor could the latter have been efficient without the
  snapping jaws, yet no minute merely indefinite variations could
  simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of structure; to deny
  this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling paradox.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin explains the appearance of some structures, the utility of
  which is not apparent, by the existence of certain "laws of correlation."
  By these he means that certain parts or organs of the body are so related
  to other organs or parts, that when the first are modified by the action
  of "Natural Selection," or what not, the second are simultaneously
  affected, and increase proportionally or possibly so decrease. Examples
  of such are the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, the general
  deafness of white cats with blue eyes, the relation between the presence
  of more or less down on young birds when first hatched, and the future
  colour of their plumage,<a name="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> with many others. But the idea that the
  modification of any internal or external part of the body of an Echinus
  carries with it the effect of producing elongated, flexible, triradiate,
  snapping processes, is, to say the very least, fully as obscure and
  mysterious as what is here contended for, viz. the efficient presence of
  an unknown internal natural law or laws conditioning the evolution of new
  specific forms from preceding ones, modified by the action of surrounding
  conditions, by "Natural Selection" and by other controlling
  influences.</p>

  <p>The same difficulty seems to present itself in other examples of
  exceptional structure and action. In the same Echinus, as in many allied
  forms, and also in some more or less remote ones, a very peculiar mode of
  development exists. The adult is not <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[46]</span>formed from the egg
  directly, but the egg gives rise to a creature which swims freely about,
  feeds, and is even somewhat complexly organized. Soon a small lump
  appears on one side of its stomach; this enlarges, and, having
  established a communication with the exterior, envelopes and appropriates
  the creature's stomach, with which it swims away and develops into the
  complete adult form, while the dispossessed individual perishes.</p>

  <p>Again, certain flies present a mode of development equally bizarre,
  though quite different. In these flies, the grub is, as usual, produced
  from the ovum, but this grub, instead of growing up into the adult in the
  ordinary way, undergoes a sort of liquefaction of a great part of its
  body, while certain patches of formative tissue, which are attached to
  the ramifying air tubes, or tracheæ (and which patches bear the name of
  "imaginal disks"), give rise to the legs, wings, eyes, &amp;c.,
  respectively; and these severally formed parts grow together, and build
  up the head and body by their mutual approximation. Such a process is
  unknown outside the class of insects, and inside that class it is only
  known in a few of the two-winged flies. Now, how "Natural Selection," or
  any "laws of correlation," can account for the gradual development of
  such an exceptional process of development&mdash;so extremely divergent
  from that of other insects&mdash;seems nothing less than inconceivable.
  Mr. Darwin himself<a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
  gives an account of a very peculiar and abnormal mode of development of a
  certain beetle, the sitaris, as described by M. Fabre. This insect,
  instead of at first appearing in its grub stage, and then, after a time,
  putting on the adult form, is at first active and furnished with six
  legs, two long antennæ, and four eyes. Hatched in the nests of bees, it
  at first attaches itself to one of the males, and then crawls, when the
  opportunity offers, upon a female bee. When the female bee lays her eggs,
  the young sitaris springs upon them <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span>and devours them. Then,
  losing its eyes, legs, and antennæ, and becoming rudimentary, it sinks
  into an ordinary grub-like form, and feeds on honey, ultimately
  undergoing another transformation, re-acquiring its legs, &amp;c., and
  emerging a perfect beetle! That such a process should have arisen by the
  accumulation of minute accidental variations in structure and habit,
  appears to many minds, quite competent to form an opinion on the subject,
  absolutely incredible.</p>

  <p>It may be objected, perhaps, that these difficulties are
  <i>difficulties of ignorance</i>&mdash;that we cannot explain them
  because we do not know <i>enough</i> of the animals. But it is here
  contended that this is not the case; it is not that we merely fail to see
  how Natural Selection acted, but that there is a positive incompatibility
  between the cause assigned and the results. It will be stated shortly
  what wonderful instances of co-ordination and of unexpected utility Mr.
  Darwin has discovered in orchids. The discoveries are not disputed or
  undervalued, but the explanation of their <i>origin</i> is deemed
  thoroughly unsatisfactory&mdash;utterly insufficient to explain the
  incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are of utility
  only when they are considerably developed.</p>

  <p>Let us consider the mammary gland, or breast. Is it conceivable that
  the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction by accidentally
  sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an accidentally
  hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even if one was so, what
  chance was there of the perpetuation of such a variation? On the
  hypothesis of Natural Selection itself, we must assume that up to that
  time the race had been well adapted to the surrounding conditions; the
  temporary and accidental trial and change of conditions, which caused the
  so-sucking young one to be the "fittest to survive" under the supposed
  circumstances, would soon cease to act, and then the progeny of the
  mother, with the accidentally hypertrophied, sebaceous glands, would have
  no tendency to survive <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>[48]</span>the far outnumbering descendants of the
  normal ancestral form. If, on the other hand, we assume the change of
  conditions not to have been temporary but permanent, and also assume that
  this permanent change of conditions was accidentally synchronous with the
  change of structure, we have a coincidence of very remote probability
  indeed. But if, again, we accept the presence of some harmonizing law
  simultaneously determining the two changes, or connecting the second with
  the first by causation, then, of course, we remove the accidental
  character of the coincidence.</p>

  <p>Again, how explain the external position of the male sexual glands in
  certain mammals? The utility of the modification, when accomplished, is
  problematical enough, and no less so the incipient stages of the
  descent.</p>

  <p>As was said in the first chapter, Mr. Darwin explains the brilliant
  plumage of the peacock or the humming-bird by the action of sexual
  selection: the more and more brilliant males being selected by the
  females (which are thus attracted) to become the fathers of the next
  generation, to which generation they tend to communicate their own bright
  nuptial vesture. But there are peculiarities of colour and of form which
  it is exceedingly difficult to account for by any such action. Thus,
  amongst apes, the female is notoriously weaker, and is armed with much
  less powerful canine tusks than the male. When we consider what is known
  of the emotional nature of these animals, and the periodicity of its
  intensification, it is hardly credible that a female would often risk
  life or limb through her admiration of a trifling shade of colour, or an
  infinitesimally greater though irresistibly fascinating degree of
  wartiness.<a name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
  <p>Yet the males of some kinds of ape are adorned with quite
  exceptionally brilliant local decoration, and the male orang is provided
  with remarkable, projecting, warty lumps of skin upon the cheeks. As we
  have said, the weaker female can hardly be supposed to have developed
  these by persevering and long-continued selection, nor can they be
  thought to tend to the preservation of the individual. On the contrary,
  the presence of this enlarged appendage must occasion a slight increase
  in the need of nutriment, and in so far must be a detriment, although its
  detrimental effect would not be worth speaking of except in relation to
  "Darwinism," according to which, <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  ages, and has ever tended to suppress any useless development by the
  struggle for life.<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
  <p>In poisonous serpents, also, we have structures which, at all events
  at first sight, seem positively hurtful to those reptiles. Such are the
  rattle of the rattlesnake, and the expanding neck of the cobra, the
  former seeming to warn the ear of the intended victim, as the latter
  warns the eye. It is true we cannot perhaps demonstrate that the victims
  are alarmed and warned, but, on <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>[51]</span>Darwinian principles, they certainly ought
  to be so. For the rashest and most incautious of the animals preyed on
  would always tend to fall victims, and the existing individuals being the
  long-descended progeny of the timid and cautious, ought to have an
  inherited tendency to distrust, amongst other things, both "rattling" and
  "expanding" snakes. As to any power of fascination exercised by means of
  these actions, the most distinguished naturalists, certainly the most
  distinguished erpetologists, entirely deny it, and it is opposed to the
  careful observations of those known to us.<a name="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The mode of formation of both the eye and the ear of the highest
  animals is such that, if it is (as most Darwinians assert processes of
  development to be) a record of the actual steps by which such structures
  were first evolved in antecedent forms, it almost amounts to a
  demonstration that those steps were never produced by "Natural
  Selection."</p>

  <p>The eye is formed by a simultaneous and corresponding ingrowth of one
  part and outgrowth of another. The skin in front of the future eye
  becomes depressed, the depression increases and assumes the form of a
  sac, which changes into the aqueous humour and lens. An outgrowth of
  brain substance, on the other hand, forms the retina, while a third
  process is a lateral ingrowth of connective tissue, which afterwards
  changes into the vitreous humour of the eye.</p>

  <p>The internal ear is formed by an involution of the integument, and not
  by an outgrowth of the brain. But tissue, in connexion with it, becomes
  in part changed, thus forming the auditory nerve, which places the
  tegumentary sac in direct communication with the brain itself.</p>

<p><!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span></p>

  <p>Now, these complex and simultaneous co-ordinations could never have
  been produced by infinitesimal beginnings, since, until so far developed
  as to effect the requisite junctions, they are useless. But the eye and
  ear when fully developed present conditions which are hopelessly
  difficult to reconcile with the mere action of "Natural Selection." The
  difficulties with regard to the eye have been well put by Mr. Murphy,
  especially that of the concordant result of visual development springing
  from different starting-points and continued on by independent roads.</p>

  <p>He says,<a name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> speaking of
  the beautiful structure of the perfect eye, "The higher the organization,
  whether of an entire organism or of a single organ, the greater is the
  number of the parts that co-operate, and the more perfect is their
  co-operation; and consequently, the more necessity there is for
  corresponding variations to take place in all the co-operating parts at
  once, and the more useless will be any variation whatever unless it is
  accompanied by corresponding variations in the co-operating parts; while
  it is obvious that the greater the number of variations which are needed
  in order to effect an improvement, the less will be the probability of
  their all occurring at once. It is no reply to this to say, what is no
  doubt abstractedly true, that whatever is possible becomes probable, if
  only time enough be allowed. There are improbabilities so great that the
  common sense of mankind treats them as impossibilities. It is not, for
  instance, in the strictest sense of the word, impossible that a poem and
  a mathematical proposition should be obtained by the process of shaking
  letters out of a box; but it is improbable to a degree that cannot be
  distinguished from impossibility; and the improbability of obtaining an
  improvement in an organ by means of several spontaneous variations, all
  occurring together, is an improbability of the same kind. If we suppose
  that any single variation occurs <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>[53]</span>on the average once in <i>m</i> times, the
  probability of that variation occurring in any individual will be</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>1<br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br /><i>m</i></td><td>;</td></tr></table>

  <p>and suppose that <i>x</i> variations must concur in order to make an
  improvement, then the probability of the necessary variations all
  occurring together will be</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>1<br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br /><i>m</i><sup>x</sup></td><td>.</td></tr></table>

  <p>Now suppose, what I think a moderate proposition, that the value of
  <i>m</i> is 1,000, and the value of <i>x</i> is 10, then</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>1<br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br /><i>m</i><sup>x</sup> </td><td> = </td><td> 1<br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br />1000<sup>10</sup> </td><td> = </td><td> 1<br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br />10<sup>30</sup></td><td>.</td></tr></table>

  <p>A number about ten thousand times as great as the number of waves of
  light that have fallen on the earth since historical time began. And it
  is to be further observed, that no improvement will give its possessor a
  <i>certainty</i> of surviving and leaving offspring, but only an <i>extra
  chance</i>, the value of which it is quite impossible to estimate." This
  difficulty is, as Mr. Murphy points out, greatly intensified by the
  undoubted fact that the wonderfully complex structure has been arrived at
  quite independently in beasts on the one hand and in cuttle-fishes on the
  other; while creatures of the insect and crab division present us with a
  third and quite separately developed complexity.</p>

  <p>As to the ear, it would take up too much space to describe its
  internal structure;<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> it
  must suffice to say that in its interior there is an immense series of
  minute rod-like bodies, termed <i>fibres of Corti</i>, having the
  appearance of a key-board, and each fibre being connected with a filament
  of the auditory nerve, these nerves being like strings to be struck by
  the keys, <i>i.e.</i> by the fibres of Corti. Moreover, this apparatus is
  supposed to be a key-board <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span>in function as well as in appearance, the
  vibration of each one fibre giving rise, it is believed, to the sensation
  of one particular tone, and combinations of such vibrations producing
  chords. It is by the action of this complex organ then, that all the
  wonderful intricacy and beauty of Beethoven and Mozart come, most
  probably, to be perceived and appreciated.</p>

  <p>Now it can hardly be contended that the preservation of any race of
  men in the struggle for life ever depended on such an extreme delicacy
  and refinement of the internal ear,&mdash;a perfection only exercised in
  the enjoyment and appreciation of the most perfect musical performances.
  How, then, could either the minute incipient stages, or the final
  perfecting touches of this admirable structure, have been brought about
  by vague, aimless, and indefinite variations in all conceivable
  directions of an organ, suitable to enable the rudest savage to minister
  to his necessities, but no more?</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace<a name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> makes an
  analogous remark with regard to the organ of voice in man&mdash;the human
  larynx. He says of singing: "The habits of savages give no indication of
  how this faculty could have been developed by Natural Selection, because
  it is never required or used by them. The singing of savages is a more or
  less monotonous howling, and the females seldom sing at all. Savages
  certainly never choose their wives for fine voices, but for rude health,
  and strength, and physical beauty. Sexual selection could not therefore
  have developed this wonderful power, which only comes into play among
  civilized people."</p>

  <p>Reverting once more to beauty of form and colour, there is one
  manifestation of it for which no one can pretend that sexual selection
  can possibly account. The instance referred to is that presented by
  bivalve shell-fish.<a name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
  Here we meet with charming tints and elegant forms and markings of no
  direct use to their <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span>possessors<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> in the struggle for life, and of no
  indirect utility as regards sexual selection, for fertilization takes
  place by the mere action of currents of water, and the least beautiful
  individual has fully as good a chance of becoming a parent as has the one
  which is the most favoured in beauty of form and colour.</p>

  <p>Again, the peculiar outline and coloration of certain
  orchids&mdash;notably of our own bee, fly, and spider orchids&mdash;seem
  hardly explicable by any action of "Natural Selection." Mr. Darwin says
  very little on this singular resemblance of flowers to insects, and what
  he does say seems hardly to be what an advocate of "Natural Selection"
  would require. Surely, for minute accidental indefinite variations to
  have built up such a striking resemblance to insects, we ought to find
  that the preservation of the plant, or the perpetuation of its race,
  depends almost constantly on relations between bees, spiders, and flies
  respectively and the bee, spider, and fly orchids.<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> This process must have continued for
  ages constantly and perseveringly, and yet what is the fact? Mr. Darwin
  tells us, in his work on the Fertilization of Orchids, that neither the
  spider nor the fly orchids are much visited by insects, while, with
  regard to the bee orchid, he says, "I have never seen an insect visit
  these flowers." And he shows how this species is even wonderfully and
  specially modified to effect self-fertilization.</p>

  <p>In the work just referred to Mr. Darwin gives a series of the most
  wonderful and minute contrivances by which the visits of insects are
  utilized for the fertilization of orchids,&mdash;structures <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span>so wonderful
  that nothing could well be more so, except the attribution of their
  origin to minute, fortuitous, and indefinite variation.</p>

  <p>The instances are too numerous and too long to quote, but in his
  "Origin of Species"<a name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> he
  describes two which must not be passed over. In one (<i>Coryanthes</i>)
  the orchid has its lower lip enlarged into a bucket, above which stand
  two water-secreting horns. These latter replenish the bucket from which,
  when half-filled, the water overflows by a spout on one side. Bees
  visiting the flower fall into the bucket and crawl out at the spout. By
  the peculiar arrangement of the parts of the flower, the first bee which
  does so carries away the pollen-mass glued to his back, and then when he
  has his next involuntary bath in another flower, as he crawls out the
  pollen-mass attached to him comes in contact with the stigma of that
  second flower and fertilizes it. In the other example (<i>Catasetum</i>),
  when a bee gnaws a certain part of the flower, he inevitably touches a
  long delicate projection, which Mr. Darwin calls the antenna. "This
  antenna transmits a vibration to a certain membrane, which is instantly
  ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth
  like an arrow in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity
  to the back of the bee!"</p>

  <p>Another difficulty, and one of some importance, is presented by those
  communities of ants which have not only a population of sterile females,
  or workers, but two distinct and very different castes of such. Mr.
  Darwin believes that he has got over this difficulty by having found
  individuals intermediate in form and structure<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> between the two working castes; others
  may think <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span>that we have in this belief of Mr. Darwin,
  an example of the unconscious action of volition upon credence. A vast
  number of difficulties similar to those which have been mentioned might
  easily be cited&mdash;those given, however, may suffice.</p>

  <p>There remains, however, to be noticed a very important consideration,
  which was brought forward in the <i>North British Review</i> for June
  1867, p. 286, namely, the necessity for the simultaneous modification of
  <i>many individuals</i>. This consideration seems to have escaped Mr.
  Darwin, for at p. 104 of his last (fifth) edition of "Natural Selection,"
  he admits, with great candour, that until reading this article he did not
  "appreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly
  marked, could be perpetuated."</p>

  <p>The <i>North British Review</i> (speaking of the supposition that a
  species is changed by the survival of a few individuals in a century
  through a similar and favourable variation) says: "It is very difficult
  to see how this can be accomplished, even when the variation is eminently
  favourable indeed; and still more difficult when the advantage gained is
  very slight, as must generally be the case. The advantage, whatever it
  may be, is utterly outbalanced by numerical inferiority. A million
  creatures are born; ten thousand survive to produce offspring. One of the
  million has twice as good a chance as any other of surviving; but the
  chances are fifty to one against the gifted individuals being one of the
  hundred survivors. No doubt the chances are twice as great against any
  one other individual, but this does not prevent their being enormously in
  favour of <i>some</i> average individual. However slight the advantage
  may be, if it is shared by half the individuals produced, it will
  probably be present in at least fifty-one of the survivors, and in a
  larger proportion of their offspring; but the chances are against the
  preservation of any one 'sport' (<i>i.e.</i> sudden, marked variation) in
  a numerous tribe. The vague use of an imperfectly understood doctrine of
  chance has led Darwinian supporters, first, to confuse the two <!-- Page
  58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[58]</span>cases above
  distinguished; and, secondly, to imagine that a very slight balance in
  favour of some individual sport must lead to its perpetuation. All that
  can be said is that in the above example the favoured sport would be
  preserved once in fifty times. Let us consider what will be its influence
  on the main stock when preserved. It will breed and have a progeny of say
  100; now this progeny will, on the whole, be intermediate between the
  average individual and the sport. The odds in favour of one of this
  generation of the new breed will be, say one and a half to one, as
  compared with the average individual; the odds in their favour will,
  therefore, be less than that of their parents; but owing to their greater
  number, the chances are that about one and a half of them would survive.
  Unless these breed together, a most improbable event, their progeny would
  again approach the average individual; there would be 150 of them, and
  their superiority would be, say in the ratio of one and a quarter to one;
  the probability would now be that nearly two of them would survive, and
  have 200 children, with an eighth superiority. Rather more than two of
  these would survive; but the superiority would again dwindle, until after
  a few generations it would no longer be observed, and would count for no
  more in the struggle for life than any of the hundred trifling advantages
  which occur in the ordinary organs. An illustration will bring this
  conception home. Suppose a white man to have been wrecked on an island
  inhabited by negroes, and to have established himself in friendly
  relations with a powerful tribe, whose customs he has learnt. Suppose him
  to possess the physical strength, energy, and ability of a dominant white
  race, and let the food and climate of the island suit his constitution;
  grant him every advantage which we can conceive a white to possess over
  the native; concede that in the struggle for existence his chance of a
  long life will be much superior to that of the native chiefs; yet from
  all these admissions, there does not follow the conclusion that, after a
  <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>[59]</span>limited or unlimited number of generations,
  the inhabitants of the island will be white. Our shipwrecked hero would
  probably become king; he would kill a great many blacks in the struggle
  for existence; he would have a great many wives and children." ... "In
  the first generation there will be some dozens of intelligent young
  mulattoes, much superior in average intelligence to the negroes. We might
  expect the throne for some generations to be occupied by a more or less
  yellow king; but can any one believe that the whole island will gradually
  acquire a white, or even a yellow, population?"</p>

  <p>"Darwin says that in the struggle for life a grain may turn the
  balance in favour of a given structure, which will then be preserved. But
  one of the weights in the scale of nature is due to the number of a given
  tribe. Let there be 7000 A's and 7000 B's, representing two varieties of
  a given animal, and let all the B's, in virtue of a slight difference of
  structure, have the better chance of life by 1/7000 part. We must allow
  that there is a slight probability that the descendants of B will
  supplant the descendants of A; but let there be only 7001 A's against
  7000 B's at first, and the chances are once more equal, while if there be
  7002 A's to start, the odds would be laid on the A's. True, they stand a
  greater chance of being killed; but then they can better afford to be
  killed. The grain will only turn the scales when these are very nicely
  balanced, and an advantage in numbers counts for weight, even as an
  advantage in structure. As the numbers of the favoured variety diminish,
  so must its relative advantages increase, if the chance of its existence
  is to surpass the chance of its extinction, until hardly any conceivable
  advantage would enable the descendants of a single pair to exterminate
  the descendants of many thousands if they and their descendants are
  supposed to breed freely with the inferior variety, and so gradually lose
  their ascendency."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin himself says of the article quoted: "The justice of these
  remarks cannot, I think, be disputed. If, for instance, <!-- Page 60
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span>a bird of some
  kind could procure its food more easily by having its beak curved, and if
  one were born with its beak strongly curved, and which consequently
  flourished, nevertheless there would be a very poor chance of this one
  individual perpetuating its kind to the exclusion of the common form."
  This admission seems almost to amount to a change of front in the face of
  the enemy!</p>

  <p>These remarks have been quoted at length because they so greatly
  intensify the difficulties brought forward in this chapter. If the most
  favourable variations have to contend with such difficulties, what must
  be thought as to the chance of preservation of the slightly displaced eye
  in a sole or of the incipient development of baleen in a whale?</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.</span></p>

  <p>It has been here contended that a certain few facts, out of many which
  might have been brought forward, are inconsistent with the origination of
  species by "Natural Selection" only or mainly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin's theory requires minute, indefinite, fortuitous variations
  of all parts in all directions, and he insists that the sole operation of
  "Natural Selection" upon such is sufficient to account for the great
  majority of organic forms, with their most complicated structures,
  intricate mutual adaptations and delicate adjustments.</p>

  <p>To this conception has been opposed the difficulties presented by such
  a structure as the form of the giraffe, which ought not to have been the
  solitary structure it is; also the minute beginnings and the last
  refinements of protective mimicry equally difficult or rather impossible
  to account for by "Natural Selection." Again the difficulty as to the
  heads of flat-fishes has been insisted on, as also the origin, and at the
  same time the constancy, of the limbs of the highest animals. Reference
  has also been made to the whalebone of whales, and to the <!-- Page 61
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span>impossibility of
  understanding its origin through "Natural Selection" only; the same as
  regards the infant kangaroo, with its singular deficiency of power
  compensated for by maternal structures on the one hand, to which its own
  breathing organs bear direct relation on the other. Again, the delicate
  and complex pedicellariæ of Echinoderms, with a certain process of
  development (through a secondary larva) found in that class, together
  with certain other exceptional modes of development, have been brought
  forward. The development of colour in certain apes, the hood of the
  cobra, and the rattle of the rattlesnake have also been cited. Again,
  difficulties as to the process of formation of the eye and ear, and as to
  the fully developed condition of those complex organs, as well as of the
  voice, have been considered. The beauty of certain shell-fish; the
  wonderful adaptations of structure, and variety of form and resemblance,
  found in orchids; together with the complex habits and social conditions
  of certain ants, have been hastily passed in review. When all these
  complications are duly weighed and considered, and when it is borne in
  mind how necessary it is for the permanence of a new variety that many
  individuals in each case should be simultaneously modified, the
  cumulative argument seems irresistible.</p>

  <p>The Author of this book can say that though by no means disposed
  originally to dissent from the theory of "Natural Selection," if only its
  difficulties could be solved, he has found each successive year that
  deeper consideration and more careful examination have more and more
  brought home to him the inadequacy of Mr. Darwin's theory to account for
  the preservation and intensification of incipient, specific, and generic
  characters. That minute, fortuitous, and indefinite variations could have
  brought about such special forms and modifications as have been
  enumerated in this chapter, seems to contradict not imagination, but
  reason. <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>[62]</span></p>

  <p>That either many individuals amongst a species of butterfly should be
  simultaneously preserved through a similar accidental and minute
  variation in one definite direction, when variations in many other
  directions would also preserve; or that one or two so varying should
  succeed in supplanting the progeny of thousands of other individuals, and
  that this should by no other cause be carried so far as to produce the
  appearance (as we have before stated) of spots of fungi,
  &amp;c.&mdash;are alternatives of an improbability so extreme as to be
  practically equal to impossibility.</p>

  <p>In spite of all the resources of a fertile imagination, the Darwinian,
  pure and simple, is reduced to the assertion of a paradox as great as any
  he opposes. In the place of a mere assertion of our ignorance as to the
  way these phenomena have been produced, he brings forward, as their
  explanation, a cause which it is contended in this work is demonstrably
  insufficient.</p>

  <p>Of course in this matter, as elsewhere throughout nature, we have to
  do with the operation of fixed and constant natural laws, and the
  knowledge of these may before long be obtained by human patience or human
  genius; but there is, it is believed, already enough evidence to show
  that these as yet unknown natural laws or law will never be resolved into
  the action of "Natural Selection," but will constitute or exemplify a
  mode and condition of organic action of which the Darwinian theory takes
  no account whatsoever. <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The theory of "Natural Selection" supposes that the varied forms and
  structure of animals and plants have been built up merely by indefinite,
  fortuitous,<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> minute
  variations in every part and in all directions&mdash;those variations
  only being preserved which are directly or indirectly useful to the
  individual possessing them, or necessarily correlated with such useful
  variations.</p>

    WINGBONES OF PTERODACTYLE, BAT, AND BIRD.<br /> (<i>Copied, by
    permission, from Mr. Andrew Murray's "Geographical Distribution of
    Mammals."</i>)
  </div>
  <p>On this theory the chances are almost infinitely great against the
  independent, accidental occurrence and preservation of two similar series
  of minute variations resulting in the independent development of two
  closely similar forms. In all cases, no doubt (on this same theory),
  <i>some</i> adaptation to habit or need <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[64]</span>would gradually be
  evolved, but that adaptation would surely be arrived at by different
  roads. The organic world supplies us with multitudes of examples of
  similar functional results being attained by the most diverse means. Thus
  the body is sustained in the air by birds and by bats. In the first case
  it is so sustained by a limb in which the bones of the hand are
  excessively reduced, but which is provided with immense outgrowths from
  the skin&mdash;namely, the feathers of the wing. In the second case,
  however, the body is sustained in the air by a limb in which the bones of
  the hand are enormously increased in length, and so sustain a great
  expanse of naked skin, which is the flying membrane of the bat's wing.
  Certain fishes and certain reptiles can also flit and take very prolonged
  jumps in the air. The flying-fish, however, takes these by means of a
  great elongation of the rays of the pectoral fins&mdash;parts which
  cannot be said to be of the same nature as the constituents of the wing
  of either the bat or the bird. The little lizard, which enjoys the
  formidable name of "flying-dragon," flits by means of a structure
  altogether peculiar&mdash;namely, by the liberation and great elongation
  of some of the ribs which support a fold of skin. In the extinct <!--
  Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span>pterodactyles&mdash;which were <i>truly</i>
  flying reptiles&mdash;we meet with an approximation to the structure of
  the bat, but in the pterodactyle we have only one finger elongated in
  each hand: a striking example of how the very same function may be
  provided for by a modification similar in principle, yet surely
  manifesting the independence of its origin. When we go to lower animals,
  we find flight produced by organs, as the wings of insects, which are not
  even modified limbs at all; or we find even the function sometimes
  subserved by quite artificial means, as in the aërial spiders, which use
  their own threads to float with in the air. In the vegetable kingdom the
  atmosphere is often made use of for the scattering of seeds, by their
  being furnished with special structures of very different kinds. The
  diverse modes by which such seeds are dispersed are well expressed by Mr.
  Darwin. He says:<a name="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> "Seeds
  <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span>are
  disseminated by their minuteness,&mdash;by their capsule being converted
  into a light balloon-like envelope,&mdash;by being embedded in pulp or
  flesh, formed of the most diverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well
  as conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and be devoured by
  birds,&mdash;by having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and serrated
  awns, so as to adhere to the fur of quadrupeds,&mdash;and by being
  furnished with wings and plumes, as different in shape as elegant in
  structure, so as to be wafted by every breeze."</p>

  <p>Again, if we consider the poisoning apparatus possessed by different
  animals, we find in serpents a perforated&mdash;or rather very deeply
  channelled&mdash;tooth. In wasps and bees the sting is formed of modified
  parts, accessory in reproduction. In the scorpion, we have the median
  terminal process of the body specially organized. In the spider, we have
  a specially constructed antenna; and finally in the centipede a pair of
  modified thoracic limbs.</p>

  </div>
  <p>It would be easy to produce a multitude of such instances of similar
  ends being attained by dissimilar means, and it is here contended that by
  "the action of Natural Selection" <i>only</i> it is so improbable as to
  be practically impossible for two exactly similar structures to have ever
  been independently developed. It is so <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>because the number of
  possible variations is indefinitely great, and it is therefore an
  indefinitely great number to one against a similar series of variations
  occurring and being similarly preserved in any two independent
  instances.</p>

  <p>The difficulty here asserted applies, however, only to pure Darwinism,
  which makes use <i>only</i> of indirect modifications through the
  survival of the fittest.</p>

  <p>Other theories (for example, that of Mr. Herbert Spencer) admit the
  <i>direct</i> action of conditions upon animals and plants&mdash;in ways
  not yet fully understood&mdash;there being conceived to be at the same
  time a certain peculiar but limited power of response and adaptation in
  each animal and plant so acted on. Such theories have not to contend
  against the difficulty proposed, and it is here urged that even very
  complex extremely similar structures have again and again been developed
  quite independently one of the other, and this because the process has
  taken place not by merely haphazard, indefinite variations in all
  directions, but by the concurrence of some other and internal natural law
  or laws co-operating with external influences and with Natural Selection
  in the evolution of organic forms.</p>

  <p>It must never be forgotten that to admit any such constant operation
  of any such unknown natural cause is to deny the purely Darwinian theory,
  which relies upon the survival of the fittest by means of minute
  fortuitous indefinite variations.</p>

  <p>Amongst many other obligations which the Author has to acknowledge to
  Professor Huxley, are the pointing out of this very difficulty, and the
  calling his attention to the striking resemblance between certain teeth
  of the dog and of the thylacine as one instance, and certain ornithic
  peculiarities of pterodactyles as another.</p>

  <p>Mammals<a name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> are
  divisible into one great group, which comprises <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[68]</span>the immense majority of
  kinds termed, from their mode of reproduction, <i>placental Mammals</i>,
  and into another very much smaller group comprising the pouched-beasts or
  marsupials (which are the kangaroos, bandicoots, phalangers, &amp;c., of
  Australia), and the true opossums of America, called <i>implacental
  Mammals</i>. Now the placental mammals are subdivided into various
  orders, amongst which are the flesh-eaters (Carnivora, <i>i.e.</i> cats,
  dogs, otters, weasels, &amp;c.), and the insect-eaters (Insectivora,
  <i>i.e.</i> moles, hedgehogs, shrew-mice, &amp;c.). The marsupial mammals
  also present a variety of forms (some of which are carnivorous beasts,
  whilst others are insectivorous), so marked that it has been even
  proposed to divide them into orders parallel to the orders of placental
  beasts.</p>

  <p>The resemblance, indeed, is so striking as, on Darwinian principles,
  to suggest the probability of genetic affinity; and it even led Professor
  Huxley, in his Hunterian Lectures, in 1866, to promulgate the notion that
  a vast and widely-diffused marsupial fauna may have existed anteriorly to
  the development of the ordinary placental, non-pouched beasts, and that
  the carnivorous, insectivorous, and herbivorous placentals may have
  respectively descended from the carnivorous, insectivorous, and
  herbivorous marsupials.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/084.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/084.png"
      alt="Teeth of Urotrichus and Perameles." title="Teeth of Urotrichus and Perameles." /></a>
    TEETH OF UROTRICHUS AND PERAMELES.
  </div>
  <p>Amongst other points Professor Huxley called attention to the
  resemblance between the anterior molars of the placental dog with those
  of the marsupial thylacine. These, indeed, are strikingly similar, but
  there are better examples still of this <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span>sort of coincidence. Thus
  it has often been remarked that the insectivorous marsupials, <i>e.g.
  Perameles</i>, wonderfully correspond, as to the form of certain of the
  grinding teeth, with certain insectivorous placentals, <i>e.g.
  Urotrichus</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, the saltatory insectivores of Africa (<i>Macroscelides</i>) not
  only resemble the kangaroo family (<i>Macropodidæ</i>) in their jumping
  habits and long hind legs, but also in the structure of their molar
  teeth, and even further, as I have elsewhere<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> pointed out, in a certain similarity of
  the upper cutting teeth, or incisors.</p>

  <p>Now these correspondences are the more striking when we bear in mind
  that a similar dentition is often put to very different uses. The food of
  different kinds of apes is very different, yet how uniform is their
  dental structure! Again, who, looking at the teeth of different kinds of
  bears, would ever suspect that one kind was frugivorous, and another a
  devourer exclusively of animal food?</p>

  <p>The suggestion made by Professor Huxley was therefore one which had
  much to recommend it to Darwinians, though it has not met with any
  notable acceptance, and though he seems himself to have returned to the
  older notion, namely, that the pouched-beasts, or marsupials, are a
  special ancient offshoot from the great mammalian class.</p>

  <p>But whichever view may be the correct one, we have in either case a
  number of forms similarly modified in harmony with surrounding
  conditions, and eloquently proclaiming some natural plastic power, other
  than mere fortuitous variation with survival of the fittest. If, however,
  the Reader thinks that teeth are parts peculiarly qualified for rapid
  variation (in which view the Author cannot concur), he is requested to
  suspend his judgment till he has considered the question of the
  independent evolution of the <i>highest organs of sense</i>. If this
  seems to establish the existence <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[70]</span>of some other law than that of "Natural
  Selection," then the operation of that other law may surely be also
  traced in the harmonious co-ordinations of dental form.</p>

  <p>The other difficulty, kindly suggested to me by the learned Professor,
  refers to the structure of birds, and of extinct reptiles more or less
  related to them.</p>

  <p>The class of birds is one which is remarkably uniform in its
  organization. So much is this the case, that the best mode of subdividing
  the class is a problem of the greatest difficulty. Existing birds,
  however, present forms which, though closely resembling in the greater
  part of their structure, yet differ importantly the one from the other.
  One form is exemplified by the ostrich, rhea, emeu, cassowary, apteryx,
  dinornis, &amp;c. These are the <i>struthious</i> birds. All other
  existing birds belong to the second division, and are called (from the
  keel on the breast-bone) <i>carinate</i> birds.</p>

  <p>Now birds and reptiles have such and so many points in common, that
  Darwinians must regard the former as modified descendants of ancient
  reptilian forms. But on Darwinian principles it is impossible that the
  class of birds so uniform and homogeneous should have had a double
  reptilian origin. If one set of birds sprang from one set of reptiles,
  and another set of birds from another set of reptiles, the two sets could
  never, by "Natural Selection" only, have grown into such a perfect
  similarity. To admit such a phenomenon would be equivalent to abandoning
  the theory of "Natural Selection" as the sole origin of species.</p>

  <p>Now, until recently it has generally been supposed by evolutionists
  that those ancient flying reptiles, the pterodactyles, or forms allied to
  them, were the progenitors of the class of birds; and certain parts of
  their structure especially support this view. Allusion is here made to
  the bladebone (scapula), and the bone which passes down from the
  shoulder-joint to the breast-bone (viz. the coracoid). These bones are
  such remarkable anticipations <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span>of the same parts in ordinary (<i>i.e.</i>
  carinate) birds that it is hardly possible for a Darwinian not to regard
  the resemblance as due to community of origin. This resemblance was
  carefully pointed out by Professor Huxley in his "Hunterian Course" for
  1867, when attention was called to the existence in <i>Dimorphodon
  macronyx</i> of even that small process which in birds gives attachment
  to the upper end of the merrythought. Also Mr. Seeley<a name="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> has shown that in pterodactyles, as in
  birds, the optic lobes of the brain were placed low down on each
  side&mdash;"lateral and depressed." Nevertheless, the view has been put
  forward and ably maintained by the same Professor,<a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> as also by Professor Cope in the United
  States, that the line of descent from reptiles to birds has not been from
  ordinary reptiles, through pterodactyle-like forms, to ordinary birds,
  but to the struthious ones from certain extinct reptiles termed
  Dinosauria; one of the most familiarly known of which is the Iguanodon of
  the Wealden formation. In these Dinosauria we find skeletal characters
  unlike those of ordinary (<i>i.e.</i> carinate) birds, but closely
  resembling in certain points the osseous structure of the struthious
  birds. Thus a difficulty presents itself as to the explanation of the
  three following relationships:&mdash;(1) That of the Pterodactyles with
  carinate birds; (2) that of the Dinosauria with struthious birds; (3)
  that of the carinate and struthious birds with each other.</p>

  <p>Either birds must have had two distinct origins whence they grew to
  their present conformity, or the very same skeletal, and probably
  cerebral characters must have spontaneously and independently arisen.
  Here is a dilemma, either horn of which bears a threatening aspect to the
  exclusive supporter of "Natural <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[72]</span>Selection," and between which it seems
  somewhat difficult to choose.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested to me that this difficulty may be evaded by
  considering pterodactyles and carinate birds as independent branches from
  one side of an ancient common trunk, while similarly the Dinosauria and
  struthious birds are taken to be independent branches from the other side
  of the same common trunk; the two kinds of birds resembling each other so
  much on account of their later development from that trunk as compared
  with the development of the reptilian forms. But to this it may be
  replied that the ancient common stock could not have had at one and the
  same time a shoulder structure of <i>both kinds</i>. It must have been
  that of the struthious birds or that of the carinate birds, or something
  different from both. If it was that of the struthious birds, how did the
  pterodactyles and carinate birds independently arrive at the very same
  divergent structure? If it was that of the carinate birds, how did the
  struthious birds and Dinosauria independently agree to differ? Finally,
  if it was something different from either, how did the carinate birds and
  pterodactyles take on independently one special common structure when
  disagreeing in so many; while the struthious birds, agreeing in many
  points with the Dinosauria, agree yet more with the carinate birds?
  Indeed by no arrangement of branches from a stem can the difficulty be
  evaded.</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley seems inclined<a name="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> to cut the Gordian knot by considering
  the shoulder structure of the pterodactyle as independently educed, and
  having relation to physiology only. This conception is one which
  harmonizes completely with the views here advocated, and with those of
  Mr. Herbert Spencer, who also calls in direct modification to the aid of
  "Natural Selection." That merely minute, indefinite variations in all
  directions should unaided have independently built up the <!-- Page 73
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[73]</span>shoulder
  structure of the pterodactyles and carinate birds, and have laterally
  depressed their optic lobes, at a time so far back as the deposition of
  the Oolite strata,<a name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> is a
  coincidence of the highest improbability; but that an innate power and
  evolutionary law, aided by the corrective action of "Natural Selection,"
  should have furnished like needs with like aids, is not at all
  improbable. The difficulty does not tell against the theory of evolution,
  but only against the specially Darwinian form of it. Now this form has
  never been expressly adopted by Professor Huxley; so far from it, in his
  lecture on this subject at the Royal Institution before referred to, he
  observes,<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> "I can
  testify, from personal experience, it is possible to have a complete
  faith in the general doctrine of evolution, and yet to hesitate in
  accepting the Nebular, or the Uniformitarian, or the Darwinian hypotheses
  in all their integrity and fulness."</p>

      alt="The Archeopteryx." title="The Archeopteryx." /></a>
    THE ARCHEOPTERYX (of the Oolite strata).
  </div>
  <p>It is quite consistent, then, in the Professor to explain the <!--
  Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>[74]</span>difficulty as he does; but it would not be
  similarly so with an absolute and pure Darwinian.</p>

  <p>Yet stronger arguments of an analogous kind are, however, to be
  derived from the highest organs of sense. In the most perfectly organized
  animals&mdash;those namely which, like ourselves, possess a spinal
  column&mdash;the internal organs of hearing consist of two more or less
  complex membranous sacs (containing calcareous particles&mdash;otoliths),
  which are primitively or permanently lodged in two chambers, one on each
  side of the cartilaginous skull. The primitive cartilaginous cranium
  supports and protects the base of the brain, and the auditory nerves pass
  from that brain into the cartilaginous chambers to reach the auditory
  sacs. These complex arrangements of parts could not have been evolved by
  "Natural Selection," <i>i.e.</i> by minute accidental variations, except
  by the action of such through a vast period of time; nevertheless, it was
  fully evolved at the time of the deposition of the upper Silurian
  rocks.</p>

  <p>Cuttle-fishes (<i>Cephalopoda</i>) are animals belonging to the
  molluscous primary division of the animal kingdom, which division
  contains animals formed upon a type of structure utterly remote from that
  on which the animals of the higher division provided with a spinal column
  are constructed. And indeed no transitional form (tending even to bridge
  over the chasm between these two groups) has ever yet been discovered,
  either living or in a fossilized condition.<a name="NtA_58"
  href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in the two-gilled Cephalopods (<i>Dibranchiata</i>) we
  find the brain supported and protected by a cartilaginous cranium. In the
  base of this cranium are two cartilaginous chambers. In each chamber is a
  membranous sac containing an otolith, and the auditory nerves pass from
  the cerebral ganglia into the cartilaginous chambers to reach the
  auditory sacs. Moreover, <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>[75]</span>it has been suggested by Professor Owen that
  sinuosities between processes projecting from the inner wall of each
  chamber "seem to be the first rudiments of those which, in the higher
  classes (<i>i.e.</i> in animals with a spinal column), are extended in
  the form of canals and spiral chambers, within the substance of the dense
  nidus of the labyrinth."<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Cuttle-fish." title="Cuttle-fish." /></a>
    CUTTLE-FISH.<br /> A. Ventral aspect. B. Dorsal
    aspect.
  </div>
  <p>Here, then, we have a wonderful coincidence indeed; two highly complex
  auditory organs, marvellously similar in structure, but which must
  nevertheless have been developed in entire and complete independence one
  of the other! It would be difficult to calculate the odds against the
  independent occurrence and conservation of two such complex series of
  merely accidental and minute haphazard variations. And it can never <!--
  Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>be
  maintained that the sense of hearing could not be efficiently subserved
  otherwise than by such sacs, in cranial cartilaginous capsules so
  situated in relation to the brain, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Our wonder, moreover, may be increased when we recollect that the
  two-gilled cephalopods have not yet been found below the lias, where they
  at once abound; whereas the four-gilled cephalopods are Silurian forms.
  Moreover, the absence is in this case significant in spite of the
  imperfection of the geological record, because when we consider how many
  individuals of various kinds of four-gilled cephalopods have been found,
  it is fair to infer that at the least a certain small percentage of
  dibranchs would also have left traces of their presence had they existed.
  Thus it is probable that some four-gilled form was the progenitor of the
  dibranch cephalopods. Now the four-gilled kinds (judging from the only
  existing form, the nautilus) had the auditory organ in a very inferior
  condition of development to what we find in the dibranch; thus we have
  not only evidence of the independent high development of the organ in the
  former, but also evidence pointing towards a certain degree of
  comparative rapidity in its development.</p>

  <p>Such being the case with regard to the organ of hearing, we have
  another yet stronger argument with regard to the organ of sight, as has
  been well pointed out by Mr. J. J. Murphy.<a name="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> He calls attention to the fact that the
  eye must have been perfected in at least "three distinct lines of
  descent," alluding not only to the molluscous division of the animal
  kingdom, and the division provided with a spinal column, but also to a
  third primary division, namely, that which includes all insects, spiders,
  crabs, &amp;c., which are spoken of as Annulosa, and the type of whose
  structure is as distinct from that of the molluscous type on the one
  hand, as it is from that of the type with a spinal column (<i>i.e.</i>
  the vertebrate type) on the other.</p>

<p><!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span></p>

  <p>In the cuttle-fishes we find an eye even more completely constructed
  on the vertebrate type than is the ear. Sclerotic, retina, choroid,
  vitreous humour, lens, aqueous humour, all are present. The
  correspondence is wonderfully complete, and there can hardly be any
  hesitation in saying that for such an exact, prolonged, and correlated
  series of similar structures to have been brought about in two
  independent instances by merely indefinite and minute accidental
  variations, is an improbability which amounts practically to
  impossibility. Moreover, we have here again the same imperfection of the
  four-gilled cephalopod, as compared with the two-gilled, and therefore
  (if the latter proceeded from the former) a similar indication of a
  certain comparative rapidity of development. Finally, and this is perhaps
  one of the most curious circumstances, the process of formation appears
  to have been, at least in some respects, the same in the eyes of these
  molluscous animals as in the eyes of vertebrates. For in these latter the
  cornea is at first perforated, while different degrees of perforation of
  the same part are presented by different adult cuttle-fishes&mdash;large
  in the calamaries, smaller in the octopods, and reduced to a minute
  foramen in the true cuttle-fish sepia.</p>

  <p>Some may be disposed to object that the conditions requisite for
  effecting vision are so rigid that similar results in all cases must be
  independently arrived at. But to this objection it may well be replied
  that Nature herself has demonstrated that there is no such necessity as
  to the details of the process. For in the higher Annulosa, such as the
  dragon-fly, we meet with an eye of an unquestionably very high degree of
  efficiency, but formed on a type of structure only remotely comparable
  with that of the fish or the cephalopod. The last-named animal might have
  had an eye as efficient as that of a vertebrate, but formed on a distinct
  type, instead of being another edition, as it were, of the very same
  structure.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of this chapter examples have been given of <!-- Page
  78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[78]</span>the very
  diverse mode in which similar results have in many instances been arrived
  at; on the other hand, we have in the fish and the cephalopod not only
  the eye, but at one and the same time the ear also similarly evolved, yet
  with complete independence.</p>

  <p>Thus it is here contended that the similar and complex structures of
  both the highest organs of sense, as developed in the vertebrates on the
  one hand, and in the mollusks on the other, present us with residuary
  phenomena for which "Natural Selection" alone is quite incompetent to
  account. And that these same phenomena must therefore be considered as
  conclusive evidence for the action of some other natural law or laws
  conditioning the simultaneous and independent evolution of these
  harmonious and concordant adaptations.</p>

  <p>Provided with this evidence, it may be now profitable to enumerate
  other correspondences, which are not perhaps in themselves inexplicable
  by Natural Selection, but which are more readily to be explained by the
  action of the unknown law or laws referred to&mdash;which action, as its
  necessity has been demonstrated in one case, becomes <i>a priori</i>
  probable in the others.</p>

  <p>Thus the great oceanic Mammalia&mdash;the whales&mdash;show striking
  resemblances to those prodigious, extinct, marine reptiles, the
  Ichthyosauria, and this not only in structures readily referable to
  similarity of habit, but in such matters as greatly elongated
  premaxillary bones, together with the concealment of certain bones of the
  skull by other cranial bones. <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Again, the aërial mammals, the bats, resemble those flying reptiles of
  the secondary epoch, the pterodactyles; not only to a certain extent in
  the breast-bone and mode of supporting the flying membrane, but also in
  the proportions of different parts of the spinal column and the hinder
  (pelvic) limbs.</p>

  <p>Also bivalve shell-fish (<i>i.e.</i> creatures of the mussel, cockle,
  and oyster class, which receive their name from the body being protected
  by a double shell, one valve of which is placed on each side) have their
  two shells united by one or two powerful muscles, which pass directly
  across from one shell to the other, and which are termed "adductor
  muscles" because by their contraction they bring together the valves and
  so close the shell.</p>

  respect, the structure of true bivalves. Allusion is here made to certain

  wonderfully like a bivalve shell, although its nature and composition are
  quite different. But this is by no means all,&mdash;not only is there
  this external resemblance between the thoracic armour of the crustacean
  and the bivalve shell, but the two sides of the ostracod and phyllopod
  thorax are connected together also by an adductor muscle!</p>

  <p>The pedicellariæ of the echinus have been already spoken of, and the
  difficulty as to their origin from minute, fortuitous, indefinite
  variations has been stated. But structures essentially similar (called
  avicularia, or "bird's-head processes") are developed from the surface of
  the compound masses of certain of the highest of the polyp-like animals
  (viz. the Polyzoa or, as they are sometimes called, the Bryozoa).</p>

  <p>These compound animals have scattered over the surface of their bodies
  minute processes, each of which is like the head of a bird, with an upper
  and lower beak, the whole supported on a slender neck. The beak opens and
  shuts at intervals, like the jaws of the pedicellariæ of the echinus, and
  there is altogether, in general principle, a remarkable similarity
  between the structures. Yet the echinus can have, at the best, none but
  the most distant genetic relationship with the Polyzoa. We have here
  again therefore complex and similar organs of diverse and independent
  origin.</p>

    BIRD'S-HEAD PROCESSES VERY GREATLY ENLARGED.
  </div>
  <p>In the highest class of animals (the Mammalia) we have almost always a
  placental mode of reproduction, <i>i.e.</i> the blood of the f&oelig;tus
  is placed in nutritive relation with the blood of the mother by means of
  vascular prominences. No trace of such a structure exists in any bird or
  in any reptile, and yet it crops out again in certain sharks. There
  indeed it might well be supposed to end, but, marvellous as it seems, it
  reappears in very lowly creatures; namely, in certain of the ascidians,
  sometimes called tunicaries or sea-squirts. <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span></p>

  <p>Now, if we were to concede that the ascidians were the common
  ancestors<a name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> of both these
  sharks and of the higher mammals, we should be little, if any, nearer to
  an explanation of the phenomenon by means of "Natural Selection," for in
  the sharks in question the vascular prominences are developed from one
  f&oelig;tal structure (the umbilical vesicle), while in the higher
  mammals they are developed from quite another part, viz. the
  allantois.</p>

  </div>
  <p>So great, however, is the number of similar, but apparently
  independent, structures, that we suffer from a perfect <i>embarras de
  richesses</i>. Thus, for example, we have the convoluted windpipe <!--
  Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span>of the
  sloth, reminding us of the condition of the windpipe in birds; and in
  another mammal, allied to the sloth, namely the great ant-eater
  (Myrmecophaga), we have again an ornithic character in its horny
  gizzard-like stomach. In man and the highest apes the cæcum has a
  vermiform appendix, as it has also in the wombat!</p>

  <p>Also the similar forms presented by the crowns of the teeth in some
  seals, in certain sharks, and in some extinct Cetacea may be referred to;
  as also the similarity of the beak in birds, some reptiles, in the
  tadpole, and cuttle-fishes. As to entire external form, may be adduced
  the wonderful similarity between a true mouse (<i>Mus delicatulus</i>)
  and a small marsupial, pointed out by Mr. Andrew Murray in his work on
  the "Geographical Distribution of Mammals," p. 53, and represented in the
  frontispiece by figures copied from Gould's "Mammals of Australia;" but
  instances enough for the present purpose have been already quoted.</p>

  <p>Additional reasons for believing that similarity of structure is
  produced by other causes than merely by "Natural Selection" are furnished
  by certain facts of zoological geography, and by a similarity in the mode
  of variation being sometimes extended to several species of a genus, or
  even to widely different groups; while the restriction and the limitation
  of such similarity are often not less remarkable. Thus Mr. Wallace
  says,<a name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> as to local
  influence: "Larger or smaller districts, or even single islands, give a
  special character to the majority of their Papilionidæ. For
  instance:&mdash;1. The species of the Indian region (Sumatra, Java, and
  Borneo) are almost invariably smaller than the allied species inhabiting
  Celebes and the Moluccas. 2. The species of New Guinea and Australia are
  also, though in a less degree, smaller than the nearest species or
  varieties of the Moluccas. 3. In the Moluccas themselves the species of
  Amboyna are the largest. 4. The species of Celebes equal or even surpass
  in size those <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[84]</span>of Amboyna. 5. The species and varieties of
  Celebes possess a striking character in the form of the anterior wings,
  different from that of the allied species and varieties of all the
  surrounding islands. 6. Tailed species in India or the Indian region
  become tailless as they spread eastward through the Archipelago. 7. In
  Amboyna and Ceram the females of several species are dull-coloured, while
  in the adjacent islands they are more brilliant." Again:<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> "In Amboyna and Ceram the female of the
  large and handsome <i>Ornithoptera Helena</i> has the large patch on the
  hind wings constantly of a pale dull ochre or buff colour; while in the
  scarcely distinguishable varieties from the adjacent islands, of Bouru
  and New Guinea, it is of a golden yellow, hardly inferior in brilliancy
  to its colour in the male sex. The female of <i>Ornithoptera Priamus</i>
  (inhabiting Amboyna and Ceram exclusively) is of a pale dusky brown tint,
  while in all the allied species the same sex is nearly black, with
  contracted white markings. As a third example, the female of <i>Papilio
  Ulysses</i> has the blue colour obscured by dull and dusky tints, while
  in the closely allied species from the surrounding islands, the females
  are of almost as brilliant an azure blue as the males. A parallel case to
  this is the occurrence, in the small islands of Goram, Matabello, Ké, and
  Aru, of several distinct species of Eupl&oelig;a and Diadema, having
  broad bands or patches of white, which do not exist in any of the allied
  species from the larger islands. These facts seem to indicate some local
  influence in modifying colour, as unintelligible and almost as remarkable
  as that which has resulted in the modifications of form previously
  described."</p>

  <p>After endeavouring to explain some of the facts in a way to be noticed
  directly, Mr. Wallace adds:<a name="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> "But even the conjectural explanation
  now given fails us in the other cases of local modification. Why the
  species of the Western Islands should be smaller than those further east;
  why those of Amboyna <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[85]</span>should exceed in size those of Gilolo and
  New Guinea; why the tailed species of India should begin to lose that
  appendage in the islands, and retain no trace of it on the borders of the
  Pacific; and why, in three separate cases, the females of Amboyna species
  should be less gaily attired than the corresponding females of the
  surrounding islands, are questions which we cannot at present attempt to
  answer. That they depend, however, on some general principle is certain,
  because analogous facts have been observed in other parts of the world.
  Mr. Bates informs me that, in three distinct groups, Papilios, which, on
  the Upper Amazon, and in most other parts of South America, have spotless
  upper wings, obtain pale or white spots at Pará and on the Lower Amazon,
  and also that the Æneas group of Papilios never have tails in the
  equatorial regions and the Amazon valley, but gradually acquire tails in
  many cases as they range towards the northern or southern tropic. Even in
  Europe we have somewhat similar facts, for the species and varieties of
  butterflies peculiar to the Island of Sardinia are generally smaller and
  more deeply coloured than those of the mainland, and the same has been
  recently shown to be the case with the common tortoiseshell butterfly in
  the Isle of Man; while <i>Papilio Hospiton</i>, peculiar to the former
  island, has lost the tail, which is a prominent feature of the closely
  allied <i>P. Machaon</i>.</p>

  <p>"Facts of a similar nature to those now brought forward would no doubt
  be found to occur in other groups of insects, were local faunas carefully
  studied in relation to those of the surrounding countries; and they seem
  to indicate that climate and other physical causes have, in some cases, a
  very powerful effect in modifying specific form and colour, and thus
  directly aid in producing the endless variety of nature."</p>

  </div>
  <p>With regard to butterflies of Celebes belonging to different families,
  they present "a peculiarity of outline which distinguishes them at a
  glance from those of any other part of the <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span>world:"<a name="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> it is that the upper wings are
  generally more elongated and the anterior margin more curved. Moreover,
  there is, in most instances, near the base an abrupt bend or elbow, which
  in some species is very conspicuous. Mr. Wallace <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[87]</span>endeavours to explain
  this phenomenon by the supposed presence at some time of special
  persecutors of the modified forms, supporting the opinion by the remark
  that small, obscure, very rapidly flying and mimicked kinds have not had
  the wing modified. Such an enemy occasioning increased powers of flight,
  or rapidity in turning, he adds, "one would naturally suppose to be an
  insectivorous bird; but it is a remarkable fact that most of the genera
  of fly-catchers of Borneo and Java on the one side, and of the Moluccas
  on the other, are almost entirely absent from Celebes. Their place seems
  to be supplied by the caterpillar-catchers, of which six or seven species
  are known from Celebes, and are very numerous in individuals. We have no
  positive evidence that these birds pursue butterflies on the wing, but it
  is highly probable that they do so when other food is scarce. Mr. Bates
  suggested to me that the larger dragon-flies prey upon butterflies, but I
  did not notice that they were more abundant in Celebes than elsewhere."<a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now, every opinion or conjecture of Mr. Wallace is worthy of
  respectful and attentive consideration, but the explanation suggested and
  before referred to hardly seems a satisfactory one. What the past fauna
  of Celebes may have been is as yet conjectural. Mr. Wallace tells us that
  now there is a remarkable <i>scarcity</i> of fly-catchers, and that their
  place is supplied by birds of which it can only be said that it is
  "highly probable" that they chase butterflies "when other food is
  scarce." The quick eye of Mr. Wallace failed to detect them in the act,
  as also to note any unusual abundance of other insectivorous forms, which
  therefore, considering Mr. Wallace's zeal and powers of observation, we
  may conclude do not exist. Moreover, even if there ever has been an
  abundance of such, it is by no means certain that they would have
  succeeded in producing the conformation in question, for the effect of
  this peculiar curvature on flight is by no means clear. We have here,
  then, a structure <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>[88]</span>hypothetically explained by an uncertain
  property induced by a cause the presence of which is only
  conjectural.</p>

  <p>Surely it is not unreasonable to class this instance with the others
  before given, in which a common modification of form or colour coexists
  with a certain geographical distribution quite independently of the
  destructive agencies of animals. If physical causes connected with
  locality can abbreviate or annihilate the tails of certain butterflies,
  why may not similar causes produce an elbow-like prominence on the wings
  of other butterflies? There are many such instances of simultaneous
  modification. Mr. Darwin himself<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> quotes Mr. Gould as believing that
  birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear
  atmosphere, than when living on islands or near the coast. Mr. Darwin
  also informs us that Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea
  affects the colour of insects; and finally, that Moquin-Tandon gives a
  list of plants which, when growing near the sea-shore, have their leaves
  in some degree fleshy, though not so elsewhere. In his work on "Animals
  and Plants under Domestication,"<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> Mr. Darwin refers to M. Costa as having
  (in <i>Bull. de la Soc. Imp. d'Acclimat</i>. tome viii. p. 351) stated
  "that young shells taken from the shores of England and placed in the
  Mediterranean at once altered their manner of growth, and formed
  prominent diverging rays <i>like those on the shells of the proper
  Mediterranean oyster</i>;" also to Mr. Meehan, as stating (<i>Proc. Acad.
  Nat. Sc. of Philadelphia</i>, Jan. 28, 1862) "that twenty-nine kinds of
  American trees all differ from their nearest European allies in <i>a
  similar manner</i>, leaves less toothed, buds and seeds smaller, fewer
  branchlets," &amp;c. These are striking examples indeed!</p>

  <p>But cases of simultaneous and similar modifications abound on all
  sides. Even as regards our own species there is a very generally admitted
  opinion that a new type has been developed in the United States, and this
  in about a couple of <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[89]</span>centuries only, and in a vast multitude of
  individuals of diverse ancestry. The instances here given, however, must
  suffice, though more could easily be added.</p>

  <p>It may be well now to turn to groups presenting similar variations,
  not through, but independently of, geographical distribution, and, as far
  as we know, independently of conditions other than some peculiar nature
  and tendency (as yet unexplained) common to members of such groups, which
  nature and tendency seem to induce them to vary in certain definite lines
  or directions which are different in different groups. Thus with regard
  to the group of insects, of which the walking leaf is a member, Mr.
  Wallace observes:<a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> "The
  <i>whole family</i><a name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> of
  the Phasmidæ, or spectres, to which this insect belongs, is more or less
  imitative, and a great number of the species are called <!-- Page 90

  insects,' from their singular resemblance to twigs and branches."</p>

  <p>Again, Mr. Wallace<a name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
  tells us of no less than four kinds of orioles, which birds mimic, more
  or less, four species of a genus of honey-suckers, the weak orioles
  finding their profit in being mistaken by certain birds of prey for the
  strong, active, and gregarious honey-suckers. Now, many other birds would
  be benefited by similar mimicry, which is none the less confined, in this
  part of the world, to the oriole genus. It is true that the absence of
  mimicry in other forms may be explained by their possessing some other
  (as yet unobserved) means of preservation. But it is nevertheless
  remarkable, not so much that one species should mimic, as that no less
  than four should do so in different <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span>ways and degrees, all
  these four belonging to <i>one and the same genus</i>.</p>

  <p>In other cases, however, there is not even the help of protective
  action to account for the phenomenon. Thus we have the wonderful birds of
  Paradise,<a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> which agree
  in developing plumage unequalled in beauty, but a beauty which, as to
  details, is of different kinds, and produced in different ways in
  different species. To develop "beauty and singularity of plumage" is a
  character of the group, but not of any one definite kind, to be explained
  merely by inheritance.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The number of similar instances which could be brought forward from
  amongst animals and plants is very great, but the <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[94]</span>examples given are, it is
  hoped, amply sufficient to point towards the conclusion which other facts
  will, it is thought, establish, viz. that there are causes operating (in
  the evocation of these harmonious diverging resemblances) other than
  "Natural Selection," or heredity, and other even than merely
  geographical, climatal, or any simply external conditions.</p>

  <p>Many cases have been adduced of striking likenesses between different
  animals, not due to inheritance; but this should be the less surprising,
  in that the very same individual presents us with likenesses between
  different parts of its body (<i>e.g.</i>, between the several joints of
  the backbone), which are certainly not so explicable. This, however,
  leads to a rather large subject, which will be spoken of in the eighth
  chapter of the present work. Here it will be enough to affirm (leaving
  the proof of the assertion till later) that parts are often homologous
  which have no direct genetic relationship,&mdash;a fact which harmonizes
  well with the other facts here given, but which "Natural Selection," pure
  and simple, seems unable to explain.</p>

  <p>But surely the independent appearance of similar organic forms is what
  we might expect, <i>a priori</i>, from the independent appearance of
  similar inorganic ones. As Mr. G. H. Lewes well observes,<a name="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> "We do not suppose the carbonates and
  phosphates found in various parts of the globe&mdash;we do not suppose
  that the families of alkaloids and salts have any nearer kinship than
  that which consists in the similarity of their elements, and the
  conditions of their combination. Hence, in organisms, as in salts,
  morphological identity may be due to a community of causal connexion,
  rather than community of descent.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Darwin justly holds it to be incredible that individuals
  identically the same should have been produced through Natural Selection
  from parents <i>specifically distinct</i>, but he will not deny that
  identical forms may issue from parents <i>genetically distinct</i>, <!--
  Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[95]</span>when
  these parent forms and the conditions of production are identical. To
  deny this would be to deny the law of causation."</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley has, however, suggested<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> that such mineral identity may be
  explained by applying also to minerals a law of descent; that is, by
  considering such similar forms as the descendants of atoms which
  inhabited one special part of the primitive nebular cosmos, each
  considerable space of which may be supposed to have been under the
  influence of somewhat different conditions.</p>

  <p>Surely, however, there can be no real parity between the relationship
  of existing minerals to nebular atoms, and the relationship of existing
  animals and plants to the earliest organisms. In the first place, the
  latter have produced others by generative multiplication, which mineral
  atoms never did. In the second, existing animals and plants spring from
  the living tissues of preceding animals and plants, while existing
  minerals spring from the chemical affinity of separate elements.
  Carbonate of soda is not formed, by a process of reproduction, from other
  carbonate of soda, but directly by the suitable juxtaposition of carbon,
  oxygen, and sodium.</p>

  <p>Instead of approximating animals and minerals in the mode suggested,
  it may be that they are to be approximated in quite a contrary fashion;
  namely, by attributing to mineral species an internal innate power. For,
  as we must attribute to each elementary atom an innate power and tendency
  to form (under the requisite external conditions) certain unions with
  other atoms, so we may attribute to certain mineral species&mdash;as
  crystals&mdash;an innate power and tendency to exhibit (the proper
  conditions being supplied) a definite and symmetrical external form. The
  distinction between animals and vegetables on the one hand, and minerals
  on the other, is that, while in the organic world close similarity is the
  result sometimes of inheritance, sometimes of direct production
  independently of parental <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span>action, in the inorganic world the latter is
  the constant and only mode in which such similarity is produced.</p>

  <p>When we come to consider the relations of species to space&mdash;in
  other words, the geographical distribution of organisms&mdash;it will be
  necessary to return somewhat to the subject of the independent origin of
  closely similar forms, in regard to which some additional remarks will be
  found towards the end of the seventh chapter.</p>

  <p>In this third chapter an effort has been made to show that while on
  the Darwinian theory concordant variations are extremely improbable, yet
  Nature presents us with abundant examples of such; the most striking of
  which are, perhaps, the higher organs of sense. Also that an important
  influence is exercised by conditions connected with geographical
  distribution, but that a deeper-seated influence is at work, which is
  hinted at by those special tendencies in definite directions, which are
  the properties of certain groups. Finally, that these facts, when taken
  together, afford strong evidence that "Natural Selection" has not been
  the exclusive or predominant cause of the various organic structural
  peculiarities. This conclusion has also been re-enforced by the
  consideration of phenomena presented to us by the inorganic world. <!--

</blockquote>

  <p>Not only are there good reasons against the acceptance of the
  exclusive operation of "Natural Selection" as the one means of specific
  origination, but there are difficulties in the way of accounting for such
  origination by the sole action of modifications which are infinitesimal
  and minute, whether fortuitous or not.</p>

  <p>Arguments may yet be advanced in favour of the view that new species
  have from time to time manifested themselves with suddenness, and by
  modifications appearing at once (as great in degree as are those which
  separate <i>Hipparion</i> from <i>Equus</i>), the species remaining
  stable in the intervals of such modifications: by stable being meant that
  their variations only extend for a certain degree in various directions,
  like oscillations in a stable equilibrium. This is the conception of Mr.
  Galton,<a name="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> who compares
  the development of species with a many facetted <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>[98]</span>spheroid tumbling over
  from one facet, or stable equilibrium, to another. The existence of
  internal conditions in animals corresponding with such facets is denied
  by pure Darwinians, but it is contended in this work, though not in this
  chapter, that something may also be said for their existence.</p>

  <p>The considerations brought forward in the last two chapters, namely,
  the difficulties with regard to incipient and closely similar structures
  respectively, together with palæontological considerations to be noticed
  later, appear to point strongly in the direction of sudden and
  considerable changes. This is notably the case as regards the young
  oysters already mentioned, which were taken from the shores of England
  and placed in the Mediterranean, and at once altered their mode of growth
  and formed prominent diverging rays, <i>like those of the proper
  Mediterranean oyster</i>; as also the twenty-nine kinds of American
  trees, all differing from their nearest European allies
  <i>similarly</i>&mdash;"leaves less toothed, buds and seeds smaller,
  fewer branchlets," &amp;c. To these may be added other facts given by Mr.
  Darwin. Thus he says, "that climate, to a certain extent, directly
  modifies the form of dogs."<a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Rev. R. Everett found that setters at Delhi, though most carefully
  paired, yet had young with "nostrils more contracted, noses more pointed,
  size inferior, and limbs more slender." Again, cats at Mombas, on the
  coast of Africa, have short stiff hairs instead of fur, and a cat at
  Algoa Bay, when left only eight weeks at Mombas, "underwent a complete
  metamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured fur."<a
  name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> The conditions of life
  seem to produce a considerable effect on horses, and instances are given
  by Mr. Darwin of pony breeds<a name="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> having independently arisen in
  different parts of the world, possessing a certain similarity in their
  physical <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>[99]</span>conditions. Also changes due to climate may
  be brought about at once in a second generation, though no appreciable
  modification is shown by the first. Thus "Sir Charles Lyell mentions that
  some Englishmen, engaged in conducting the operations of the Real del
  Monte Company in Mexico, carried out with them some greyhounds of the
  best breed to hunt the hares which abound in that country. It was found
  that the greyhounds could not support the fatigues of a long chase in
  this attenuated atmosphere, and before they could come up with their prey
  they lay down gasping for breath; but these same animals have produced
  whelps, which have grown up, and are not in the least degree incommoded
  by the want of density in the air, but run down the hares with as much
  ease as do the fleetest of their race in this country."<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have here no action of "Natural Selection;" it was not that certain
  puppies happened accidentally to be capable of enduring more rarefied
  air, and so survived, but the offspring were directly modified by the
  action of surrounding conditions. Neither was the change elaborated by
  minute modifications in many successive generations, but appeared at once
  in the second.</p>

  <p>With regard once more to sudden alterations of form, Nathusius is said
  to state positively as to pigs,<a name="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> that the result of common experience
  and of his experiments was that rich and abundant food, given during
  youth, tends by some direct action to make the head broader and shorter.
  Curious jaw appendages often characterize Normandy pigs, according to M.
  Eudes Deslongchamps. Richardson figures these appendages on the old
  "Irish greyhound pig," and they are said by Nathusius to appear
  occasionally in all the long-eared races. Mr. Darwin observes,<a
  name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> "As no wild pigs are
  known to have analogous <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span>appendages, we have at present no reason
  to suppose that their appearance is due to reversion; and if this be so,
  we are forced to admit that somewhat complex, though apparently useless
  structures may be suddenly developed without the aid of selection."
  Again, "Climate directly affects the thickness of the skin and hair" of
  cattle.<a name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> In the English
  climate an individual Porto Santo rabbit<a name="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> recovered the proper colour of its fur
  in rather less than four years. The effect of the climate of India on the
  turkey is considerable. Mr. Blyth<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> describes it as being much degenerated
  in size, "utterly incapable of rising on the wing," of a black colour,
  and "with long pendulous appendages over the beak enormously developed."
  Mr. Darwin again tells us that there has suddenly appeared in a bed of
  common broccoli a peculiar variety, faithfully transmitting its newly
  acquired and remarkable characters;<a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> also that there have been a rapid
  transformation and transplantation of American varieties of maize with a
  European variety;<a name="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> that
  certainly "the Ancon and Manchamp breeds of sheep," and that (all but
  certainly) Niata cattle, turnspit and pug dogs, jumper and frizzled
  fowls, short-faced tumbler pigeons, hook-billed ducks, &amp;c., and a
  multitude of vegetable varieties, have suddenly appeared in nearly the
  same state as we now see them.<a name="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> Lastly, Mr. Darwin tells us, that there
  has been an occasional development (in five distinct cases) in England of
  the "japanned" or "black-shouldered peacock" (<i>Pavo nigripennis</i>), a
  distinct species, according to Dr. Sclater,<a name="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> yet arising in Sir J. Trevelyan's flock
  composed entirely of the common kind, and increasing, "<i>to the
  extinction of the previously existing breed</i>."<a name="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Mr. Darwin's only explanation of the
  phenomena (on the supposition of the <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>[101]</span>species being distinct)
  is by reversion, owing to a supposed ancestral cross. But he candidly
  admits, "I have heard of no other such case in the animal or vegetable
  kingdom." On the supposition of its being only a variety, he observes,
  "The case is the most remarkable ever recorded of the abrupt appearance
  of a new form, which so closely resembles a true species, that it has
  deceived one of the most experienced of living ornithologists."</p>

  <p>As to plants, M. C. Naudin<a name="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> has given the following instances of
  the sudden origination of apparently permanent forms. "The first case
  mentioned is that of a poppy, which took on a remarkable variation in its
  fruit&mdash;a crown of secondary capsules being added to the normal
  central capsule. A field of such poppies was grown, and M. Göppert, with
  seed from this field, obtained still this monstrous form in great
  quantity. Deformities of ferns are sometimes sought after by
  fern-growers. They are now always obtained by taking spores from the
  abnormal parts of the monstrous fern; from which spores ferns presenting
  the same peculiarities invariably grow.... The most remarkable case is
  that observed by Dr. Godron, of Nancy. In 1861 that botanist observed,
  amongst a sowing of <i>Datura tatula</i>, the fruits of which are very
  spinous, a single individual of which the capsule was perfectly smooth.
  The seeds taken from this plant all furnished plants having the character
  of this individual. The fifth and sixth generations are now growing
  without exhibiting the least tendency to revert to the spinous form. More
  remarkable still, when crossed with the normal <i>Datura tatula</i>,
  hybrids were produced, which, in the second generation, reverted to the
  original types, as true hybrids do."</p>

  <p>There are, then, abundant instances to prove that considerable <!--
  Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[102]</span>modifications may suddenly develop
  themselves, either due to external conditions or to obscure internal
  causes in the organisms which exhibit them. Moreover, these
  modifications, from whatever cause arising, are capable of
  reproduction&mdash;the modified individuals "breeding true."</p>

  <p>The question is whether new species have been developed by
  non-fortuitous variations which are insignificant and minute, or whether
  such variations have been comparatively sudden, and of appreciable size
  and importance? Either hypothesis will suit the views here maintained
  equally well (those views being opposed only to fortuitous, indefinite
  variations), but the latter is the more remote from the Darwinian
  conception, and yet has much to be said in its favour.</p>

  <p>Professor Owen considers, with regard to specific origination, that
  natural history "teaches that the change would be sudden and
  considerable: it opposes the idea that species are transmitted by minute
  and slow degrees."<a name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> "An
  innate tendency to deviate from parental type, operating through periods
  of adequate duration," being "the most probable nature, or way of
  operation of the secondary law, whereby species have been derived one
  from the other."<a name="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now, considering the number of instances adduced of sudden
  modifications in domestic animals, it is somewhat startling to meet with
  Mr. Darwin's dogmatic assertion that it is "a <i>false belief</i>" that
  natural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner. The
  belief <i>may</i> be false, but it is difficult to see how its falsehood
  can be positively asserted.</p>

  <p>It is demonstrated by Mr. Darwin's careful weighings and measurements,
  that, though little used parts in domestic animals get reduced in weight
  and somewhat in size, yet that they show no inclination to become truly
  "rudimentary structures." <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>[103]</span>Accordingly he asserts<a name="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> that such rudimentary parts are formed
  "suddenly, by arrest of development" in domesticated animals, but in wild
  animals slowly. The latter assertion, however, is a <i>mere
  assertion</i>; necessary, perhaps, for the theory of "Natural Selection,"
  but as yet unproved by facts.</p>

  <p>But why should not these changes take place suddenly in a state of
  nature? As Mr. Murphy says,<a name="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> "It may be true that we have no
  evidence of the origin of wild species in this way. But this is not a
  case in which negative evidence proves anything. We have never witnessed
  the origin of a wild species by any process whatever; and if a species
  were to come suddenly into being in the wild state, as the Ancon Sheep
  did under domestication, how could you ascertain the fact? If the first
  of a newly-begotten species were found, the fact of its discovery would
  tell nothing about its origin. Naturalists would register it as a very
  rare species, having been only once met with, but they would have no
  means of knowing whether it were the first or the last of its race."</p>

  <p>To this Mr. Wallace has replied (in his review of Mr. Murphy's work in
  <i>Nature</i><a name="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>), by
  objecting that sudden changes could very rarely be useful, because each
  kind of animal is a nicely balanced and adjusted whole, any one sudden
  modification of which would in most cases be hurtful unless accompanied
  by other simultaneous and harmonious modifications. If, however, it is
  not unlikely that there is an innate tendency to deviate at certain
  times, and under certain conditions, it is no more unlikely that that
  innate tendency should be an harmonious one, calculated to simultaneously
  adjust the various parts of the organism to their new relations. The
  objection as to the sudden abortion of rudimentary organs may be
  similarly met.</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley seems now disposed to accept the, at least <!-- Page
  104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>[104]</span>occasional, intervention of sudden and
  considerable variations. In his review of Professor Kölliker's<a
  name="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> criticisms, he himself
  says,<a name="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> "We greatly
  suspect that she" (<i>i.e.</i> Nature) "does make considerable jumps in
  the way of variation now and then, and that these saltations give rise to
  some of the gaps which appear to exist in the series of known forms."</p>

  <p>In addition to the instances brought forward in the second chapter
  against the minute action of Natural Selection, may be <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span>mentioned such
  structures as the wonderfully folded teeth of the labyrinthodonts. The
  marvellously complex structure of these organs is not merely
  unaccountable as due to Natural "Selection," but its production by
  insignificant increments of complexity is hardly less difficult to
  comprehend.</p>

  <p>Similarly the aborted index of the Potto (<i>Perodicticus</i>) is a
  structure not likely to have been induced by minute changes; while, as to
  "Natural Selection," the reduction of the fore-finger to a mere rudiment
  is inexplicable indeed! "How this mutilation can have aided in the
  struggle for life, we must confess, baffles our conjectures on the
  subject; for that any very appreciable gain to the individual can have
  resulted from the slightly lessened degree of required nourishment thence
  resulting (<i>i.e.</i> from the suppression), seems to us to be an almost
  absurd proposition."<a name="NtA_99"

  <p>Again, to anticipate somewhat, the great group of whales (Cetacea) was
  fully developed at the deposition of the Eocene strata. On the other
  hand, we may pretty safely conclude that these animals were absent as
  late as the latest secondary rocks, so that their development could not
  have been so very slow, unless geological time is (although we shall
  presently see there are grounds to believe it is not) practically
  infinite. It is quite true that it is, in general, very unsafe to infer
  the absence of any animal forms <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>[106]</span>during a certain geological period,
  because no remains of them have as yet been found in the strata then
  deposited: but in the case of the Cetacea it is safe to do so; for, as
  Sir Charles Lyell remarks,<a name="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> they are animals, the remains of
  which are singularly likely to have been preserved had they existed, in
  the same way that the remains were preserved of the Ichthyosauri and
  Plesiosauri, which appear to have represented the Cetacea during the
  secondary geological period.</p>

  <p>As another example, let us take the origin of wings, such as exist in
  birds. Here we find an arm, the bones of the hand of which are atrophied
  and reduced in number, as compared with those of most other Vertebrates.
  Now, if the wing arose from a terrestrial or subaërial organ, this
  abortion of the bones could hardly have been serviceable&mdash;hardly
  have preserved individuals in the struggle for life. If it arose from an
  aquatic organ, like the wing of the penguin, we have then a singular
  divergence from the ordinary vertebrate fin-limb. In the ichthyosaurus,
  in the plesiosaurus, in the whales, in the porpoises, in the seals, and
  in others, we have shortening of the bones, but no reduction in the
  number either of the fingers or of their joints, which are, on the
  contrary, multiplied in Cetacea and the ichthyosaurus. And even in the
  turtles we have eight carpal bones and five digits, <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span>while no
  finger has less than two phalanges. It is difficult, then, to believe
  that the Avian limb was developed in any other way than by a
  comparatively sudden modification of a marked and important kind.</p>

    SKELETON OF AN ICHTHYOSAURUS.
  </div>
  <p>How, once more, can we conceive the peculiar actions of the tendrils
  of some climbing plants to have been produced by minute modifications?
  These, according to Mr. Darwin,<a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> oscillate till they touch an object,
  and then embrace it. It is stated by that observer, "that a thread
  weighing no more than the thirty-second of a grain, if placed on the
  tendril of the <i>Passiflora gracilis</i>, will cause it to bend; and
  merely to touch the tendril with a twig causes it to bend; but if the
  twig is at once removed, the tendril soon straightens itself. But the
  contact of other tendrils of the plant, or of the falling of drops of
  rain, do not produce these effects."<a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> But some of the zoological and
  anatomical discoveries of late years tend rather to diminish than to
  augment the evidence in favour of minute and gradual modification. Thus
  all naturalists now admit that certain animals, which were at one time
  supposed to be connecting links between groups, belong altogether to one
  group, and not at all to the other. For example, the aye-aye<a
  name="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> (<i>Chiromys
  Madagascariensis</i>). <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span>was till lately considered to be allied to
  the squirrels, and was often classed with them in the rodent order,
  principally on account of its dentition; at the same time that its
  affinities to the lemurs and apes were admitted. The thorough
  investigation into its anatomy that has now been made, demonstrates that
  it has no more essential affinity to rodents than any other lemurine
  creature has.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">

    THE AYE-AYE.
  </div>
  <p>Bats were, by the earliest observers, naturally supposed to have a
  close relationship to birds, and cetaceans to fishes. It is almost
  superfluous to observe that all now agree that these mammals make not
  even an approach to either one or other of the two inferior classes.</p>

<p><!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span></p>

  <p>In the same way it has been recently supposed that those extinct
  flying saurians, the pterodactyles, had an affinity with birds more
  marked than any other known animals. Now, however, as has been said
  earlier, it is contended that not only had they no such close affinity,
  but that other extinct reptiles had a far closer one.</p>

  <p>The <i>amphibia</i> (<i>i.e.</i> frogs, toads, and efts) were long
  considered (and are so still by some) to be reptiles, showing an affinity
  to fishes. It now appears that they form with the latter one great
  group&mdash;the ichthyopsida of Professor Huxley&mdash;which differs
  widely from reptiles; while its two component classes (fishes and
  amphibians) are difficult to separate from each other in a thoroughly
  satisfactory manner.</p>

  <p>If we admit the hypothesis of gradual and minute modification, the
  succession of organisms on this planet must have been a progress from the
  more general to the more special, and no doubt this has been the case in
  the majority of instances. Yet it cannot be denied that some of the most
  recently formed fossils show a structure singularly more generalized than
  any exhibited by older forms; while others are more specialized than are
  any allied creatures of the existing creation.</p>

  <p>A notable example of the former circumstance is offered by
  macrauchenia&mdash;a hoofed animal, which was at first supposed to be a
  kind of great llama (whence its name)&mdash;the llama being a ruminant,
  which, like all the rest, has two toes to each foot. Now hoofed animals
  are divisible into two very distinct series, according as the number of
  functional toes on each hind foot is odd or even. And many other
  characters are found to go with this obvious one. Even the very earliest
  Ungulata show this distinction, which is completely developed and marked
  even in the Eocene palæotherium and anoplotherium found in Paris by
  Cuvier. The former of these has the toes odd (perissodactyle), the other
  has them even (artiodactyle).</p>

  <p>Now, the macrauchenia, from the first relics of it which were <!--
  Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[110]</span>found, was thought to belong, as has been
  said, to the even-toed division. Subsequent discoveries, however, seemed
  to give it an equal claim to rank amongst the perissodactyle forms.
  Others again inclined the balance of probability towards the
  artiodactyle. Finally, it appears that this very recently extinct beast
  presents a highly generalized type of structure, uniting in one organic
  form both artiodactyle and perissodactyle characters, and that in a
  manner not similarly found in any other known creature living, or fossil.
  At the same time the differentiation of artiodactyle and perissodactyle
  forms existed as long ago as in the period of the Eocene ungulata, and
  that in a marked degree, as has been before observed.</p>

  <p>Again, no armadillo <i>now living</i> presents nearly so remarkable a
  speciality of structure as was possessed by the <i>extinct</i> glyptodon.
  In that singular animal the spinal column had most of its joints fused
  together, forming a rigid cylindrical rod, a modification, as far as yet
  known, absolutely peculiar to it.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/126.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/126.png"
      alt="Dentition of the Sabre-toothed Tiger." title="Dentition of the Sabre-toothed Tiger." /></a>
    DENTITION OF THE SABRE-TOOTHED TIGER (MACHAIRODUS).
  </div>
  <p>In a similar way the <i>extinct</i> machairodus, or sabre-toothed
  tiger, is characterized by a more highly differentiated and specially
  carnivorous dentition than is shown by any predacious beast of <!-- Page
  111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[111]</span>the
  <i>present day</i>. The specialization is of this kind. The grinding
  teeth (or molars) of beasts are divided into premolars and true molars.
  The premolars are molars which have deciduous vertical predecessors (or
  milk teeth), and any which are in front of such, <i>i.e.</i> between such
  and the canine tooth. The true molars are those placed behind the molars
  having deciduous vertical predecessors. Now, as a dentition becomes more
  distinctly carnivorous, so the hindmost molars and the foremost premolars
  disappear. In the existing cats this process is carried so far that in
  the upper jaw only one true molar is left on each side. In the
  machairodus there is no upper true molar at all, while the premolars are
  reduced to two, there being only these two teeth above, on each side,
  behind the canine.</p>

  <p>Now, with regard to these instances of early specialization, as also
  with regard to the changed estimate of the degrees of affinity between
  forms, it is not pretended for a moment that such facts are
  irreconcilable with "Natural Selection." Nevertheless, they point in an
  opposite direction. Of course not only is it conceivable that certain
  antique types arrived at a high degree of specialization and then
  disappeared; but it is manifest they did do so. Still the fact of this
  early degree of excessive specialization tells to a certain, however
  small, extent against a progress through excessively minute steps,
  whether fortuitous or not; as also does the distinctness of forms
  formerly supposed to constitute connecting links. For, it must not be
  forgotten, that if species have manifested themselves generally by
  gradual and minute modifications, then the absence, not in one but in
  <i>all cases</i>, of such connecting links, is a phenomenon which remains
  to be accounted for.</p>

  <p>It appears then that, apart from fortuitous changes, there are certain
  difficulties in the way of accepting extremely minute modifications of
  any kind, although these difficulties may not be insuperable. Something,
  at all events, is to be <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>said in favour of the opinion that sudden
  and appreciable changes have from time to time occurred, however they may
  have been induced. Marked <i>races</i> have undoubtedly so arisen (some
  striking instances having been here recorded), and it is at least
  conceivable that such may be the mode of <i>specific</i> manifestation
  generally, the possible conditions as to which will be considered in a
  later chapter. <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a

</blockquote>

  <p>As was observed in the preceding chapters, arguments may yet be
  advanced in favour of the opinion that species are stable (at least in
  the intervals of their comparatively sudden successive manifestations);
  that the organic world consists, according to Mr. Galton's
  before-mentioned conception, of many facetted spheroids, each of which
  can repose upon any one facet, but, when too much disturbed, rolls over
  till it finds repose in stable equilibrium upon another and distinct
  facet. Something, it is here contended, may be urged, in favour of the
  existence of such facets&mdash;of such intermitting conditions of stable
  equilibrium.</p>

  <p>A view as to the stability of species, in the intervals of change, has
  been well expressed in an able article, before quoted from, as follows:<a
  name="NtA_104" href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>&mdash;"A given animal
  or plant appears to be <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>contained, as it were, within a sphere of
  variation: one individual lies near one portion of the surface; another
  individual, of the same species, near another part of the surface; the
  average animal at the centre. Any individual may produce descendants
  varying in any direction, but is more likely to produce descendants
  varying towards the centre of the sphere, and the variations in that
  direction will be greater in amount than the variations towards the
  surface." This might be taken as the representation of the normal
  condition of species (<i>i.e.</i> during the periods of repose of the
  several facets of the spheroids), on that view which, as before said, may
  yet be defended.</p>

  <p>Judging the organic world from the inorganic, we might expect, <i>a
  priori</i>, that each species of the former, like crystallized species,
  would have an approximate limit of form, and even of size, and at the
  same time that the organic, like the inorganic forms, would present
  modifications in correspondence with surrounding conditions; but that
  these modifications would be, not minute and insignificant, but definite
  and appreciable, equivalent to the shifting of the spheroid on to another
  facet for support.</p>

  <p>Mr. Murphy says,<a name="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>
  "Crystalline formation is also dependent in a very remarkable way on the
  medium in which it takes place." "Beudant has found that common salt
  crystallizing from pure water forms cubes, but if the water contains a
  little boracic acid, the angles of the cubes are truncated. And the Rev.
  E. Craig has found that carbonate of copper, crystallizing from a
  solution containing sulphuric acid, forms hexagonal tubular prisms; but
  if a little ammonia is added, the form changes to that of a long
  rectangular prism, with secondary planes in the angles. If a little more
  ammonia is added, several varieties of rhombic octahedra appear; if a
  little nitric acid is added, the rectangular prism appears again. The
  changes take place not by the addition of new crystals, but by changing
  the growth of <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span>the original ones." These, however, may be
  said to be the same species, after all; but recent researches by Dr. H.
  Charlton-Bastian seem to show that modifications in the conditions may
  result in the evolution of forms so diverse as to constitute different
  organic species.</p>

  <p>Mr. Murphy observes<a name="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> that "it is scarcely possible to
  doubt that the various forms of fungi which are characteristic of
  particular situations are not really distinct species, but that the same
  germ will develop into different forms, according to the soil on which it
  falls;" but it is possible to interpret the facts differently, and it may
  be that these are the manifestations of really different and distinct
  species, developed according to the different and distinct circumstances
  in which each is placed. Mr. Murphy quotes Dr. Carpenter<a name="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> to the effect that "No
  <i>Puccinia</i> but the <i>Puccinia rosæ</i> is found upon rose bushes,
  and this is seen nowhere else; <i>Omygena exigua</i> is said to be never
  seen but on the hoof of a dead horse; and <i>Isaria felina</i> has only
  been observed upon the dung of cats, deposited in humid and obscure
  situations." He adds, "We can scarcely believe that the air is full of
  the germs of distinct species of fungi, of which one never vegetates
  until it falls on the hoof of a dead horse, and another till it falls on
  cat's dung in a damp and dark place." This is true, but it does not quite
  follow that they are necessarily the same species if, as Dr. Bastian
  seems to show, thoroughly different and distinct organic forms<a
  name="NtA_108" href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> can be evolved one
  from another by modifying the conditions. This observer has brought
  forward arguments and facts from which it would appear that such
  definite, sudden, and considerable transformations may take place in the
  lowest organisms. If such is really the case, we might expect, <i>a
  priori</i>, to find in the highest organisms a tendency (much more
  impeded <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span>and rare in its manifestations) to
  similarly appreciable and sudden changes, under certain stimuli; but a
  tendency to continued stability, under normal and ordinary conditions.
  The proposition that species have, under ordinary circumstances, a
  definite limit to their variability, is largely supported by facts
  brought forward by the zealous industry of Mr. Darwin himself. It is
  unquestionable that the degrees of variation which have been arrived at
  in domestic animals have been obtained more or less readily in a moderate
  amount of time, but that further development in certain desired
  directions is in some a matter of extreme difficulty, and in others
  appears to be all but, if not quite, an impossibility. It is also
  unquestionable that the degree of divergence which has been attained in
  one domestic species is no criterion of the amount of divergence which
  has been attained in another. It is contended on the other side that we
  have no evidence of any limits to variation other than those imposed by
  physical conditions, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as those which determine the
  greatest degree of speed possible to any animal (of a given size) moving
  over the earth's surface; also it is said that the differences in degree
  of change shown by different domestic animals depend in great measure
  upon the abundance or scarcity of individuals subjected to man's
  selection, together with the varying direction and amount of his
  attention in different cases; finally, it is said that the changes found
  in nature are within the limits to which the variation of domestic
  animals extends,&mdash;it being the case that when changes of a certain
  amount have occurred to a species under nature, it becomes <i>another
  species</i>, or sometimes <i>two or more other species</i> by divergent
  variations, each of these species being able again to vary and diverge in
  any useful direction.</p>

  <p>But the fact of the rapidly increasing difficulty found in producing
  by ever such careful selection, any further extreme in some charge
  already carried very far (such as the tail of the "fan-tailed pigeon" or
  the crop of the "pouter"), is certainly, so <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span>far as it goes, on the
  side of the existence of definite limits to variability. It is asserted
  in reply, that physiological conditions of health and life may bar any
  such further development. Thus, Mr. Wallace says<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> of these developments: "Variation
  seems to have reached its limits in these birds. But so it has in nature.
  The fantail has not only more tail-feathers than any of the three hundred
  and forty existing species of pigeons, but more than any of the eight
  thousand known species of birds. There is, of course, some limit to the
  number of feathers of which a tail useful for flight can consist, and in
  the fantail we have probably reached that limit. Many birds have the
  &oelig;sophagus or the skin of the neck more or less dilatable, but in no
  known bird is it so dilatable as in the pouter pigeon. Here again the
  possible limit, compatible with a healthy existence, has probably been
  reached. In like manner, the differences in the size and form of the beak
  in the various breeds of the domestic pigeon, is greater than that
  between the extreme forms of beak in the various genera and sub-families
  of the whole pigeon tribe. From these facts, and many others of the same
  nature, we may fairly infer, that if rigid selection were applied to any
  organ, we could in a comparatively short time produce a much greater
  amount of change than that which occurs between species and species in a
  state of nature, since the differences which we do produce are often
  comparable with those which exist between distinct genera or distinct
  families."</p>

  <p>But in a domestic bird like the fantail where Natural Selection does
  not come into play, the tail-feathers could hardly be limited by "utility
  for flight," yet two more tail-feathers could certainly exist in a fancy
  breed if "utility for flight" were the only obstacle. It seems probable
  that the real barrier is an <i>internal</i> one in the nature of the
  organism, and the existence of such is just what is contended for in this
  chapter. As to the <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>[118]</span>differences between domestic races being
  greater than those between species or even genera, that is not enough for
  the argument. For upon the theory of "Natural Selection" all birds have a
  common origin, from which they diverged by infinitesimal changes, so that
  we ought to meet with sufficient changes to warrant the belief that a
  hornbill could be produced from a humming-bird, proportionate time being
  allowed.</p>

  <p>But not only does it appear that there are barriers which oppose
  change in certain directions, but that there are positive tendencies to
  development along certain special lines. In a bird which has been kept
  and studied like the pigeon, it is difficult to believe that any
  remarkable spontaneous variations would pass unnoticed by breeders, or
  that they would fail to be attended to and developed by some one fancier
  or other. On the hypothesis of <i>indefinite</i> variability, it is then
  hard to say why pigeons with bills like toucans, or with certain feathers
  lengthened like those of trogans, or those of birds of paradise, have
  never been produced. This, however, is a question which may be settled by
  experiment. Let a pigeon be bred with a bill like a toucan's, and with
  the two middle tail-feathers lengthened like those of the king bird of
  paradise, or even let individuals be produced which exhibit any marked
  tendency of the kind, and indefinite variability shall be at once
  conceded.</p>

  <p>As yet all the changes which have taken place in pigeons are of a few
  definite kinds only, such as may be well conceived to be compatible with
  a species possessed of a certain inherent capacity for considerable yet
  definite variation, a capacity for the ready production of certain
  degrees of abnormality, which then cannot be further increased.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin himself has already acquiesced in the proposition here
  maintained, inasmuch as he distinctly affirms the existence of a marked
  internal barrier to change in certain cases. And if this is admitted in
  one case, the <i>principle</i> is conceded, and it immediately becomes
  probable that such internal barriers exist <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[119]</span>in all, although
  enclosing a much larger field for variation in some cases than in others.
  Mr. Darwin abundantly demonstrates the variability of dogs, horses,
  fowls, and pigeons, but he none the less shows clearly the <i>very
  small</i> extent to which the goose, the peacock, and the guinea-fowl
  have varied.<a name="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> Mr.
  Darwin attempts to explain this fact as regards the goose by the animal
  being valued only for food and feathers, and from no pleasure having been
  felt in it on other accounts. He adds, however, at the end the striking
  remark,<a name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> which
  concedes the whole position, "but the goose seems to have <i>a singularly
  inflexible organization</i>." This is not the only place in which such
  expressions are used. He elsewhere makes use of phrases which quite
  harmonize with the conception of a normal specific constancy, but varying
  greatly and suddenly at intervals. Thus he speaks<a name="NtA_112"
  href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> of a <i>whole organization seeming to
  have become plastic, and tending to depart from the parental type</i>.
  That different organisms should have different degrees of variability, is
  only what might have been expected <i>a priori</i> from the existence of
  parallel differences in inorganic species, some of these having but a
  single form, and others being polymorphic.</p>

  <p>To return to the goose, however, it may be remarked that it is at
  least as probable that its fixity of character is the cause of the
  neglect, as the reverse. It is by no means unfair to assume that
  <i>had</i> the goose shown a tendency to vary similar in degree to the
  tendency to variation of the fowl or pigeon, it would have received
  attention at once on that account.</p>

  <p>As to the peacock it is excused on the pleas (1), that the individuals
  maintained are so few in number, and (2) that its beauty is so great it
  can hardly be improved. But the individuals maintained <i>have not been
  too few</i> for the independent origin of the black-shouldered form, or
  for the supplanting of the <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>[120]</span>commoner one by it. As to any neglect in
  selection, it can hardly be imagined that with regard to this bird (kept
  as it is all but exclusively for its beauty), any spontaneous beautiful
  variation in colour or form would have been neglected. On the contrary,
  it would have been seized upon with avidity and preserved with anxious
  care. Yet apart from the black-shouldered and white varieties, no
  tendency to change has been known to show itself. As to its being too
  beautiful for improvement, that is a proposition which can hardly be
  maintained. Many consider the Javan bird as much handsomer than the
  common peacock, and it would be easy to suggest a score of improvements
  as regards either species.</p>

  <p>The guinea-fowl is excused, as being "no general favourite, and
  scarcely more common than the peacock;" but Mr. Darwin himself shows and
  admits that it is a noteworthy instance of constancy under very varied
  conditions.</p>

  <p>These instances alone (and there are yet others) seem sufficient to
  establish the assertion, that degree of change is different in different
  domestic animals. It is, then, somewhat unwarrantable in any Darwinian to
  assume that <i>all</i> wild animals have a capacity for change similar to
  that existing in <i>some</i> of the domestic ones. It seems more
  reasonable to assert the opposite, namely, that if, as Mr. Darwin says,
  the capacity for change is different in different domestic animals, it
  must surely be limited in those which have it least, and <i>a
  fortiori</i> limited in wild animals.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it cannot be reasonably maintained that wild species certainly
  vary as much as do domestic races; it is possible that they may do so,
  but at least this has not been yet shown. Indeed, the much greater degree
  of variation amongst domestic animals than amongst wild ones is asserted
  over and over again by Mr. Darwin, and his assertions are supported by an
  overwhelming mass of facts and instances.</p>

  <p>Of course, it may be asserted that a tendency to indefinite change
  exists in all cases, and that it is only the <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[121]</span>circumstances and
  conditions of life which modify the effects of this tendency to change so
  as to produce such different results in different cases. But assertion is
  not proof, and this assertion has not been proved. Indeed, it may be
  equally asserted (and the statement is more consonant with some of the
  facts given), that domestication in certain animals induces and occasions
  a capacity for change which is wanting in wild animals&mdash;the
  introduction of new causes occasioning new effects. For, though a certain
  degree of variability (normally, in all probability, only oscillation)
  exists in all organisms, yet domestic ones are exposed to new and
  different causes of variability, resulting in such striking divergencies
  as have been observed. Not even in this latter case, however, is it
  necessary to believe that the variability is indefinite, but only that
  the small oscillations become in certain instances intensified into large
  and conspicuous ones. Moreover, it is possible that some of our domestic
  animals have been in part chosen and domesticated through possessing
  variability in an eminent degree.</p>

  <p>That each species exhibits certain oscillations of structure is
  admitted on all hands. Mr. Darwin asserts that this is the exhibition of
  a tendency to vary which is absolutely indefinite. If this indefinite
  variability <i>does</i> exist, of course no more need be said. But we
  have seen that there are arguments <i>a priori</i> and <i>a
  posteriori</i> against it, while the occurrence of variations in certain
  domestic animals greater in degree than the differences between many wild
  species, is no argument in favour of its existence, until it can be shown
  that the causes of variability in the one case are the same as in the
  other. An argument against it, however, may be drawn from the fact, that
  certain animals, though placed under the influence of those exceptional
  causes of variation to which domestic animals are subject, have yet never
  been known to vary, even in a degree equal to that in which certain wild
  kinds have been ascertained to vary.</p>

  <p>In addition to this immutability of character in some animals, <!--
  Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>it is
  undeniable, that domestic varieties have little stability, and much
  tendency to reversion, whatever be the true explanation of such
  phenomena.</p>

  <p>In controverting the generally received opinion as to "reversion," Mr.
  Darwin has shown that it is not all breeds which in a few years revert to
  the original form; but he has shown no more. Thus, the feral rabbits of
  Porto Santo, Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, have not yet so reverted
  in those several localities.<a name="NtA_113"
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> Nevertheless, a Porto Santo rabbit
  brought to England reverted in a manner the most striking, recovering the
  proper colour of its fur "in rather less than four years."<a
  name="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> Again, the white silk
  fowl, in our climate, "reverts to the ordinary colour of the common fowl
  in its skin and bones, due care having been taken to prevent any
  cross."<a name="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> This
  reversion taking place in spite of careful selection, is very
  remarkable.</p>

  <p>Numerous other instances of reversion are given by Mr. Darwin, both as
  regards plants and animals; amongst others, the singular fact of bud
  reversion.<a name="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> The
  curiously recurring development of black sheep, in spite of the most
  careful breeding, may also be mentioned, though, perhaps, reversion has
  no part in the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>These facts seem certainly to tell in favour of limited variability,
  while the cases of non-reversion do not contradict it, as it is not
  contended that all species have the same tendency to revert, but rather
  that their capacities in this respect, as well as for change, are
  different in different kinds, so that often reversion may only show
  itself at the end of very long periods indeed.</p>

  <p>Yet some of the instances given as probable or possible causes of
  reversion by Mr. Darwin, can hardly be such. He cites, for example, the
  occasional presence of supernumerary digits in man.<a name="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> For this notion, however, he is not
  responsible, <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span>as he rests his remark on the authority of
  a passage published by Professor Owen. Again, he refers<a name="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> to "the greater frequency of a
  monster proboscis in the pig than in any other animal." But with the
  exception of the peculiar muzzle of the Saiga (or European antelope), the
  only known proboscidian Ungulates are the elephants and tapirs, and to
  neither of these has the pig any close affinity. It is rather in the
  horse than in the pig that we might look for the appearance of a
  reversionary proboscis, as both the elephants and the tapirs have the
  toes of the hind foot of an odd number. It is true that the elephants are
  generally considered to form a group apart from both the odd and the
  even-toed Ungulata. But of the two, their affinities with the odd-toed
  division are more marked.<a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another argument in favour of the, at least intermitting, constancy of
  specific forms and of sudden modification, may be drawn from the absence
  of minute transitional forms, but this will be considered in the next
  chapter.</p>

  <p>It remains now to notice in favour of specific stability, that the
  objection drawn from physiological difference between "species" and
  "races" still exists unrefuted.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin freely admits difficulties regarding the sterility of
  different species when crossed, and shows satisfactorily that it could
  never have arisen from the action of "Natural Selection." He remarks<a
  name="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> also: "With some few
  exceptions, in the case of plants, domesticated varieties, such as those
  of the dog, fowl, pigeon, several fruit trees, and culinary vegetables,
  which differ from each other in external characters more than many
  species, are perfectly fertile when crossed, or even fertile <!-- Page
  124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[124]</span>in excess,
  whilst closely allied species are almost invariably in some degree
  sterile."</p>

  <p>Again, after speaking of "the general law of good being, derived from
  the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species," and the
  evidence that the pollen of a distinct <i>variety</i> or race is
  prepotent over a flower's own pollen, adds the very significant remark,<a
  name="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> "When distinct
  <i>species</i> are crossed, the case is directly the reverse, for a
  plant's own pollen is almost always prepotent over foreign pollen."</p>

  <p>Again he adds:<a name="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> "I
  believe from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had
  great experience in hybridizing pheasants and fowls, that the early death
  of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. Mr.
  Salter has recently given the results of an examination of about 500 eggs
  produced from various crosses between three species of Gallus and their
  hybrids. The majority of these eggs had been fertilized, and in the
  majority of the fertilized eggs the embryos either had been partially
  developed and had then aborted, or had become nearly mature, but the
  young chickens had been unable to break through the shell. Of the
  chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died within the first few
  days, or at latest weeks, 'without any obvious cause, apparently from
  mere inability to live,' so that from 500 eggs only twelve chickens were
  reared. The early death of hybrid embryos probably occurs in like manner
  with plants, at least it is known that hybrids raised from very distinct
  species are sometimes weak and dwarfed, and perish at an early age, of
  which fact Max Wichura has recently given some striking cases with hybrid
  willows."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin objects to the notion that there is any special sterility
  imposed to check specific intermixture and change, saying,<a
  name="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> "To grant to species
  the special power of producing <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>[125]</span>hybrids, and then to stop their further
  propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to
  the facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>But this only amounts to saying that the author himself would not have
  so acted had he been the Creator. A "strange arrangement" must be
  admitted anyhow, and all who acknowledge teleology at all, must admit
  that the strange arrangement was designed. Mr. Darwin says, as to the
  sterility of species, that the cause lies exclusively in their sexual
  constitution; but all that need be affirmed is that sterility is brought
  about somehow, and it is undeniable that "crossing" <i>is</i> checked.
  All that is contended for is that there <i>is</i> a bar to the
  intermixture of <i>species</i>, but not of <i>breeds</i>; and if the
  conditions of the generative products are that bar, it is enough for the
  argument, no special kind of barring action being contended for.</p>

  <p>He, however, attempts to account for the modification of the sexual
  products of species as compared with those of varieties, by the exposure
  of the former to more uniform conditions during longer periods of time
  than those to which varieties are exposed, and that as wild animals, when
  captured, are often rendered sterile by captivity, so the influence of
  union with another species may produce a similar effect. It seems to the
  author an unwarrantable assumption that a cross with what, on the
  Darwinian theory, can only be a slightly diverging descendant of a common
  parent, should produce an effect equal to that of captivity, and
  consequent change of habit, as well as considerable modification of
  food.</p>

  <p>No clear case has been given by Mr. Darwin in which mongrel animals,
  descended from the same undoubted species, have been persistently
  infertile <i>inter se</i>; nor any clear case in which hybrids between
  animals, generally admitted to be distinct species, have been
  continuously fertile <i>inter se</i>.</p>

  <p>It is true that facts are brought forward tending to establish the
  probability of the doctrine of Pallas, that species may <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[126]</span>sometimes be
  rendered fertile by domestication. But even if this were true, it would
  be no approximation towards proving the converse, <i>i.e.</i> that races
  and varieties may become sterile when wild. And whatever may be the
  preference occasionally shown by certain breeds to mate with their own
  variety, no sterility is recorded as resulting from unions with other
  varieties. Indeed, Mr. Darwin remarks,<a name="NtA_124"
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> "With respect to sterility from the
  crossing of domestic races, I know of no well-ascertained case with
  animals. This fact (seeing the great difference in structure between some
  breeds of pigeons, fowls, pigs, dogs, &amp;c.) is extraordinary when
  contrasted with the sterility, of many closely-allied natural species
  when crossed."</p>

  <p>It has been alleged that the domestic and wild guinea-pig do not breed
  together, but the specific identity of these forms is very problematical.
  Mr. A. D. Bartlett, superintendent of the Zoological Gardens, whose
  experience is so great, and observation so quick, believes them to be
  decidedly distinct species.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, it seems that a certain normal specific stability in
  species, accompanied by occasional sudden and considerable modifications,
  might be expected <i>a priori</i> from what we know of crystalline
  inorganic forms and from what we may anticipate with regard to the lowest
  organic ones. This presumption is strengthened by the knowledge of the
  increasing difficulties which beset any attempt to indefinitely intensify
  any race characteristics. The obstacles to this indefinite
  intensification, as well as to certain lines of variation in certain
  cases, appear to be not only external, but to depend on internal causes
  or an internal cause. We have seen that Mr. Darwin himself implicitly
  admits the principle of specific stability in asserting the singular
  inflexibility of the organization of the goose. We have also seen that it
  is not fair to conclude that all wild races can vary as much as the most
  variable domestic ones. It has <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>[127]</span>also been shown that there are grounds for
  believing in a tendency to reversion generally, as it is distinctly
  present in certain instances. Also that specific stability is confirmed
  by the physiological obstacles which oppose themselves to any
  considerable or continued intermixture of species, while no such barriers
  oppose themselves to the blending of varieties. All these considerations
  taken together may fairly be considered as strengthening the belief that
  specific manifestations are relatively stable. At the same time the view
  advocated in this book does not depend upon, and is not identified with,
  any such stability. All that the Author contends for is that specific
  manifestation takes place along certain lines, and according to law, and
  not in an exceedingly minute, indefinite, and fortuitous manner. Finally,
  he cannot but feel justified, from all that has been brought forward, in
  reiterating the opening assertion of this chapter that something is still
  to be said for the view which maintains that species are stable, at least
  in the intervals of their comparatively rapid successive manifestations.

</blockquote>

  <p>Two considerations present themselves with regard to the necessary
  relation of species to time if the theory of "Natural Selection" is valid
  and sufficient.</p>

  <p>The first is with regard to the evidences of the past existence of
  intermediate form, their duration and succession.</p>

  <p>The second is with regard to the total amount of time required for the
  evolution of all organic forms from a few original ones, and the bearing
  of other sciences on this question of time.</p>

  <p>As to the first consideration, evidence is as yet against the
  modification of species by "Natural Selection" alone, because not only
  are minutely transitional forms generally absent, but they are absent in
  cases where we might certainly <i>a priori</i> have expected them to be
  present. <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>[129]</span></p>

  <p>Now it has been said:<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> "If Mr. Darwin's theory be true, the
  number of varieties differing one from another a very little must have
  been indefinitely great, so great indeed as probably far to exceed the
  number of individuals which have existed of any one variety. If this be
  true, it would be more probable that no two specimens preserved as
  fossils should be of one variety than that we should find a great many
  specimens collected from a very few varieties, provided, of course, the
  chances of preservation are equal for all individuals." "It is really
  strange that vast numbers of perfectly similar specimens should be found,
  the chances against their perpetuation as fossils are so great; but it is
  also very strange that the specimens should be so exactly alike as they
  are, if, in fact, they came and vanished by a gradual change."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin attempts<a name="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> to show cause why we should believe
  <i>a priori</i> that intermediate varieties would exist in lesser numbers
  than the more extreme forms; but though they would doubtless do so
  sometimes, it seems too much to assert that they would do so generally,
  still less universally. Now little less than universal and very marked
  inferiority in numbers would account for the absence of certain series of
  minutely intermediate fossil specimens. The mass of palæontological
  evidence is indeed overwhelmingly against minute and gradual
  modification. It is true that when once an animal has obtained powers of
  flight its means of diffusion are indefinitely increased, and we might
  expect to find many relics of an aërial form and few of its antecedent
  state&mdash;with nascent wings just commencing their suspensory power.
  Yet had such a slow mode of origin, as Darwinians contend for, operated
  exclusively in all cases, it is absolutely incredible that birds, bats,
  and pterodactyles should have left the remains they have, and yet not a
  <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>[130]</span>single relic be preserved in any one
  instance of any of these different forms of wing in their incipient and
  relatively imperfect functional condition!</p>

    WING-BONES OF PTERODACTYLE, BAT, AND BIRD.
  </div>
  <p>Whenever the remains of bats have been found they have presented the
  exact type of existing forms, and there is as yet no indication of the
  conditions of an incipient elevation from the ground.</p>

  <p>The pterodactyles, again, though a numerous group, are all true and
  perfect pterodactyles, though surely <i>some</i> of the many incipient
  forms, which on the Darwinian theory have existed, must have had a good
  chance of preservation.</p>

  <p>As to birds, the only notable instance in which discoveries recently
  made appear to fill up an important hiatus, is the interpretation given
  by Professor Huxley<a name="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
  to the remains of Dinosaurian reptiles, and which were noticed in the
  third chapter of this work. The learned Professor has (as also has
  Professor Cope in America) shown that in very important and <!-- Page 131
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span>significant
  points the skeletons of the Iguanodon and of its allies approach very
  closely to that existing in the ostrich, emeu, rhea, &amp;c. He has given
  weighty reasons for thinking that the line of affinity between birds and
  reptiles passes to the birds last named from the Dinosauria rather than
  from the Pterodactyles, through Archeopteryx-like forms to the ordinary
  birds. Finally, he has thrown out the suggestion that the celebrated
  footsteps left by some extinct three-toed creatures on the very ancient
  sandstone of Connecticut were made, not, as hitherto supposed, by true
  birds, but by more or less ornithic reptiles. But even supposing all that
  is asserted or inferred on this subject to be fully proved, it would not
  approach to a demonstration of specific origin by <i>minute</i>
  modification. And though it harmonizes well with "Natural Selection," it
  is equally consistent with the rapid and sudden development of new
  specific forms of life. Indeed, Professor Huxley, with a laudable caution
  and moderation too little observed by some Teutonic Darwinians, guarded
  himself carefully from any imputation of asserting dogmatically the
  theory of "Natural Selection," while upholding fully the doctrine of
  evolution.</p>

  <p>But, after all, it is by no means certain, though very probable, that
  the Connecticut footsteps were made by very ornithic reptiles, or
  extremely sauroid birds. And it must not be forgotten that a completely
  carinate<a name="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> bird (the
  Archeopteryx) existed at a time, when, as yet, we have no evidence of
  some of the Dinosauria having come into being. Moreover, if the
  remarkable and minute similarity of the coracoid of a pterodactyle to
  that of a bird be merely the result of function and no sign of genetic
  affinity, it is not inconceivable that pelvic and leg resemblances of
  Dinosauria to birds may be functional likewise, <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>though such an
  explanation is, of course, by no means necessary to support the view
  maintained in this book.</p>

  </div>
  <p>But the number of forms represented by many individuals, yet by <i>no
  transitional ones</i>, is so great that only two or three can be selected
  as examples. Thus those remarkable fossil reptiles, the Ichthyosauria and
  Plesiosauria, extended, through the secondary period, probably over the
  greater part of the globe. Yet no single transitional form has yet been
  met with in spite of the multitudinous individuals preserved. Again, with
  their modern representatives the Cetacea, one or two aberrant forms <!--
  Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[133]</span>alone
  have been found, but no series of transitional ones indicating minutely
  the line of descent. This group, the whales, is a very marked one, and it
  is curious, on Darwinian principles, that so few instances tending to
  indicate its mode of origin should have presented themselves. Here, as in
  the bats, we might surely expect that some relics of unquestionably
  incipient stages of its development would have been left.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;">

      alt="Skeleton of a Plesiosaurus." title="Skeleton of a Plesiosaurus." /></a>
    SKELETON OF A PLESIOSAURUS.
  </div>
  <p>The singular order Chelonia, including the tortoises, turtles, and
  terrapins (or fresh-water tortoises), is another instance of an extreme
  form without any, as yet known, transitional stages. Another group may be
  finally mentioned, viz. the frogs and toads, anourous Batrachians, of
  which we have at present no relic of any kind linking them on to the Eft
  group on the one hand, or to reptiles on the other.</p>

  <p>The only instance in which an approach towards a series of nearly
  related forms has been obtained is the existing horse, its predecessor
  Hipparion and other extinct forms. But even here there is no proof
  whatever of modification by minute and infinitesimal steps; <i>a
  fortiori</i> no approach to a proof of modification by "Natural
  Selection," acting upon indefinite fortuitous variations. On the
  contrary, the series is an admirable example of successive modification
  in one special direction along one beneficial line, and the teleologist
  must <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>[134]</span>here be allowed to consider that one
  motive of this modification (among probably an indefinite number of
  motives inconceivable to us) was the relationship in which the horse was
  to stand to the human inhabitants of this planet. These extinct forms, as
  Professor Owen, remarks,<a name="NtA_129"
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> "differ from each other in a greater
  degree than do the horse, zebra, and ass," which are not only good
  <i>zoological</i> species as to form, but are species
  <i>physiologically</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they cannot produce a race of hybrids
  fertile <i>inter se</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the mere action of surrounding conditions, the same Professor
  remarks:<a name="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> "Any
  modification affecting the density of the soil might so far relate to the
  changes of limb-structure, as that a foot with a pair of small hoofs
  dangling by the sides of the large one, like those behind the cloven hoof
  of the ox, would cause the foot of Hipparion, <i>e.g.</i>, and <i>a
  fortiori</i> the broader based three-hoofed foot of the Palæothere, to
  sink less deeply into swampy soil, and be more easily withdrawn than the
  more concentratively simplified and specialized foot of the horse.
  Rhinoceroses and zebras, however, tread together the arid plains of
  Africa in the present day; and the horse has multiplied in that half of
  America where two or more kinds of tapir still exist. That the continents
  of the Eocene or Miocene periods were less diversified in respect of
  swamp and sward, pampas or desert, than those of the Pliocene period, has
  no support from observation or analogy."</p>

  <p>Not only, however, do we fail to find any traces of the incipient
  stages of numerous very peculiar groups of animals, but it is undeniable
  that there are instances which appeared at first to indicate a <i>gradual
  transition</i>, yet which instances have been shown by further
  investigation and discovery not to indicate truly anything of the kind.
  Thus at one time the remains of Labyrinthodonts, which up till then had
  been discovered, seemed to justify the opinion that as time went on,
  forms had <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>[135]</span>successively appeared with more and more
  complete segmentation and ossification of the backbone, which in the
  earliest forms was (as it is in the lowest fishes now) a soft continuous
  rod or notochord. Now, however, it is considered probable that the soft
  back-boned Labyrinthodont Archegosaurus, was an immature or larval
  form,<a name="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> while
  Labyrinthodonts with completely developed vertebræ have been found to
  exist amongst the very earliest forms yet discovered. The same may be
  said regarding the eyes of the trilobites, some of the oldest forms
  having been found as well furnished in that respect as the very last of
  the group which has left its remains accessible to observation.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/151.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/151.png"
      alt="Trilobite." title="Trilobite." /></a>
    TRILOBITE.
  </div>
  <p>Such instances, however, as well as the way in which marked and
  special forms (as the Pterodactyles, &amp;c., before referred to) appear
  at once in and similarly disappear from the geological record, are of
  course explicable on the Darwinian theory, provided a sufficiently
  enormous amount of past time be allowed. The alleged extreme, and
  probably great, imperfection of that record may indeed be pleaded in
  excuse. But it <i>is</i> an excuse.<a name="NtA_132"
  href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[136]</span>Nor is it possible to
  deny the <i>a priori</i> probability of the preservation of at least a
  few <i>minutely transitional</i> forms in some instances if <i>every</i>
  species without exception has arisen exclusively by such minute and
  gradual transitions.</p>

  <p>It remains, then, to turn to the other considerations with regard to
  the relation of species to time: namely (1) as to the total amount of
  time allowable by other sciences for organic evolution; and (2) the
  proportion existing, on Darwinian principles, between the time anterior
  to the earlier fossils, and the time since; as evidenced by the
  proportion between the amount of evolutionary change during the latter
  epoch and that which must have occurred anteriorly.</p>

  <p>Sir William Thomson has lately<a name="NtA_133"
  href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> advanced arguments from three
  distinct lines of inquiry, and agreeing in one approximate result. The
  three lines of inquiry were&mdash;1. The action of the tides upon the
  earth's rotation. 2. The probable length of time during which the sun has
  illuminated this planet; and 3. The temperature of the interior of the
  earth. The result arrived at by these investigations is a conclusion that
  the existing state of things on the earth, life on the earth, all
  geological history showing continuity of life, must be limited within
  some such period of past time as one hundred million years. The first
  question which suggests itself, supposing Sir W. Thomson's views to be
  correct, is, Is this period anything like enough for the evolution of all
  organic forms by "Natural Selection"? The second is, Is this period
  anything like enough for the deposition of the strata which must have
  been deposited if all organic forms have been evolved by <i>minute</i>
  steps, according to the Darwinian theory?</p>

  <p>In the first place, as to Sir William Thomson's views, the Author of
  this book cannot presume to advance any opinion; but the fact that they
  have not been refuted, pleads strongly in <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[137]</span>their favour when we
  consider how much they tell against the theory of Mr. Darwin. The
  last-named author only remarks that "many of the elements in the
  calculation are more or less doubtful,"<a name="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> and Professor Huxley<a name="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> does not attempt to <i>refute</i> Sir
  W. Thomson's arguments, but only to show cause for suspense of judgment,
  inasmuch as the facts <i>may be</i> capable of other explanations.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace, on the other hand,<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> seems more disposed to accept them,
  and, after considering Sir William's objections and those of Mr. Croll,
  puts the probable date of the beginning of the Cambrian deposits<a
  name="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> at only twenty-four
  million years ago. On the other hand, he seems to consider that specific
  change has been more rapid than generally supposed, and exceptionally
  stable during the last score or so of thousand years.</p>

  <p>Now, first, with regard to the time required for the evolution of all
  organic forms by merely accidental, minute, and fortuitous variations,
  the useful ones of which have been preserved:</p>

  <p>Mr. Murphy<a name="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> is
  distinctly of opinion that there has not been time enough. He says, "I am
  inclined to think that geological time is too short for the evolution of
  the higher forms of life out of the lower by that accumulation of
  imperceptibly slow variations, to which alone Darwin ascribes the whole
  process."</p>

  <p>"Darwin justly mentions the greyhound as being equal to any natural
  species in the perfect co-ordination of its parts, 'all adapted for
  extreme fleetness and for running down weak prey.'" "Yet it is an
  artificial species (and not <i>physiologically</i> a species <i>at
  all</i>), formed by long-continued selection under domestication; and
  there is no reason to suppose that any of the variations which have been
  selected to form it have been other than gradual and <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span>almost
  imperceptible. Suppose that it has taken five hundred years to form the
  greyhound out of his wolf-like ancestor. This is a mere guess, but it
  gives the order of the magnitude." Now, if so, "how long would it take to
  obtain an elephant from a protozoon, or even from a tadpole-like fish?
  Ought it not to take much more than a million times as long?"<a
  name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin<a name="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> would
  compare with the natural origin of a species "unconscious selection, that
  is, the preservation of the most useful or beautiful animals, with no
  intention of modifying the breed." He adds: "But by this process of
  unconscious selection, various breeds have been sensibly changed in the
  course of two or three centuries."</p>

  <p>"Sensibly changed!" but not formed into "new species." Mr. Darwin, of
  course, could not mean that species <i>generally</i> change so rapidly,
  which would be strangely at variance with the abundant evidence we have
  of the stability of animal forms as represented on Egyptian monuments and
  as shown by recent deposits. Indeed, he goes on to say,&mdash;"Species,
  however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same country
  only a few change at the same time. This slowness follows from all the
  inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted to each
  other, that places in the polity of nature do not occur until after long
  intervals, when changes of some kind in the physical conditions, or
  through immigration, have occurred, and individual differences and
  variations of the right nature, by which some of the inhabitants might be
  better fitted to their new places under altered circumstances, might not
  at once occur." This is true, and not only will these changes occur at
  distant intervals, but it must be borne in mind that in tracing back an
  animal to a remote ancestry, we pass through modifications of such
  rapidly increasing number and importance that a geometrical progression
  can alone indicate the increase of periods <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span>which such profound
  alterations would require for their evolution through "Natural Selection"
  only.</p>

  <p>Thus let us take for an example the proboscis monkey of Borneo
  (<i>Semnopithecus nasalis</i>). According to Mr. Darwin's own opinion,
  this form might have been "sensibly changed" in the course of two or
  three centuries. According to this, to evolve it as a true and perfect
  species one thousand years would be a very moderate period. Let ten
  thousand years be taken to represent approximately the period of
  substantially constant conditions during which no considerable change
  would be brought about. Now, if one thousand years may represent the
  period required for the evolution of the species <i>S. nasalis</i>, and
  of the other species of the genus Semnopithecus; ten times that period
  should, I think, be allowed for the differentiation of that genus, the
  African Cercopithecus and the other genera of the family
  Simiidæ&mdash;the differences between the genera being certainly more
  than tenfold greater than those between the species of the same genus.
  Again we may perhaps interpose a period of ten thousand years'
  comparative repose.</p>

  <p>For the differentiation of the families Simiidæ and Cebidæ&mdash;so
  very much more distinct and different than any two genera of either
  family&mdash;a period ten times greater should, I believe, be allowed
  than that required for the evolution of the subordinate groups. A
  similarly increasing ratio should be granted for the successive
  developments of the difference between the Lemuroid and the higher forms
  of primates; for those between the original primate and other root-forms
  of placental mammals; for those between primary placental and implacental
  mammals, and perhaps also for the divergence of the most ancient stock of
  these and of the monotremes, for in all these cases modifications of
  structure appear to increase in complexity in at least that ratio.
  Finally, a vast period must be granted for the development of the lowest
  mammalian type from the primitive stock of the whole vertebrate
  sub-kingdom. Supposing this primitive stock <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span>to have arisen directly
  from a very lowly organized animal indeed (such as a nematoid worm, or an
  ascidian, or a jelly-fish), yet it is not easy to believe that less than
  two thousand million years would be required for the totality of animal
  development by no other means than minute, fortuitous, occasional, and
  intermitting variations in all conceivable directions. If this be even an
  approximation to the truth, then there seem to be strong reasons for
  believing that geological time is not sufficient for such a process.</p>

  <p>The second question is, whether there has been time enough for the
  deposition of the strata which must have been deposited, if all organic
  forms have been evolved according to the Darwinian theory?</p>

  <p>Now this may at first seem a question for geologists only, but, in
  fact, in this matter geology must in some respects rather take its time
  from zoology than the reverse; for if Mr. Darwin's theory be true, past
  time down to the deposition of the Upper Silurian strata can have been
  but a very small fraction of that during which strata have been
  deposited. For when those Upper Silurian strata were formed, organic
  evolution had already run a great part of its course, perhaps the
  longest, slowest, and most difficult part of that course.</p>

  <p>At that ancient epoch not only were the vertebrate, molluscous, and
  arthropod types distinctly and clearly differentiated, but highly
  developed forms had been produced in each of these sub-kingdoms. Thus in
  the Vertebrata there were fishes not belonging to the lowest but to the
  very highest groups which are known to have ever been developed, namely,
  the Elasmobranchs (the highly organized sharks and rays) and the Ganoids,
  a group now poorly represented, but for which the sturgeon may stand as a
  type, and which in many important respects more nearly resemble higher
  Vertebrata than do the ordinary or osseous fishes. Fishes in which the
  ventral fins are placed in front of the pectoral ones (<i>i.e.</i>
  jugular fishes) have been generally considered to be comparatively modern
  forms. But Professor <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>[141]</span>Huxley has kindly informed me that he has
  discovered a jugular fish in the Permian deposits.</p>

  <p>Amongst the molluscous animals we have members of the very highest
  known class, namely, the Cephalopods, or cuttle-fish class; and amongst
  articulated animals we find Trilobites and Eurypterida, which do not
  belong to any incipient worm-like group, but are distinctly
  differentiated Crustacea of no low form.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/091.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/091.png"
      alt="Cuttle-fish." title="Cuttle-fish." /></a>
    CUTTLE-FISH.<br /> A. Ventral aspect. B. Dorsal
    aspect.
  </div>
  <p>We have in all these animal types nervous systems differentiated on
  distinctly different patterns, fully formed organs of circulation,
  digestion, excretion, and generation, complexly constructed eyes and
  other sense organs; in fact, all the most elaborate and complete animal
  structures built up, and not only once, for in the fishes and mollusca we
  have (as described in the third chapter of this work) the coincidence of
  the independently developed organs of sense attaining a nearly similar
  complexity <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>[142]</span>in two quite distinct forms. If, then, so
  small an advance has been made in fishes, molluscs, and arthropods since
  the Upper Silurian deposits, it will probably be within the mark to
  consider that the period before those deposits (during which all these
  organs would, on the Darwinian theory, have slowly built up their
  different perfections and complexities) occupied time at least a
  hundredfold greater.</p>

  <p>Now it will be a moderate computation to allow 25,000,000 years for
  the deposition of the strata down to and including the Upper Silurian.
  If, then, the evolutionary work done during this deposition, only
  represents a hundredth part of the sum total, we shall require
  2,500,000,000 (two thousand five hundred million) years for the complete
  development of the whole animal kingdom to its present state. Even one
  quarter of this, however, would far exceed the time which physics and
  astronomy seem able to allow for the completion of the process.</p>

  <p>Finally, a difficulty exists as to the reason of the absence of rich
  fossiliferous deposits in the oldest strata&mdash;if life was then as
  abundant and varied as, on the Darwinian theory, it must have been. Mr.
  Darwin himself admits<a name="NtA_141"
  href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> "the case at present must remain
  inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the
  views" entertained in his book.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, we find a wonderful (and on Darwinian principles an all
  but inexplicable) absence of minutely transitional forms. All the most
  marked groups, bats, pterodactyles, chelonians, ichthyosauria, anoura,
  &amp;c., appear at once upon the scene. Even the horse, the animal whose
  pedigree has been probably best preserved, affords no conclusive evidence
  of specific origin by infinitesimal, fortuitous variations; while some
  forms, as the labyrinthodonts and trilobites, which seemed to exhibit
  gradual change, are shown by further investigation to do nothing of the
  sort. As regards the time required for evolution (whether estimated by
  <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>[143]</span>the probably minimum period required for
  organic change or for the deposition of strata which accompanied that
  change), reasons have been suggested why it is likely that the past
  history of the earth does not supply us with enough. First, because of
  the prodigious increase in the importance and number of differences and
  modifications which we meet with as we traverse successively greater and
  more primary zoological groups; and, secondly, because of the vast series
  of strata necessarily deposited if the period since the Lower Silurian
  marks but a small fraction of the period of organic evolution. Finally,
  the absence or rarity of fossils in the oldest rocks is a point at
  present inexplicable, and not to be forgotten or neglected.</p>

  <p>Now all these difficulties are avoided if we admit that new forms of
  animal life of all degrees of complexity appear from time to time with

</blockquote>

  <p>The study of the distribution of animals over the earth's surface
  presents us with many facts having certain not unimportant bearings on
  the question of specific origin. Amongst these are instances which, at
  least at first sight, appear to conflict with the Darwinian theory of
  "Natural Selection." It is not, however, here contended that such facts
  do by any means constitute by themselves obstacles which cannot be got
  over. Indeed it would be difficult to imagine any obstacles of the kind
  which could not be surmounted by an indefinite number of terrestrial
  modifications of surface&mdash;submergences and
  emergences&mdash;junctions and separations of continents in all
  directions and combinations of any desired degree of frequency. All this
  being supplemented by the intercalation of armies of enemies, multitudes
  of ancestors of all kinds, and myriads of connecting forms, whose
  <i>raison d'être</i> <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>[145]</span>may be simply their utility or necessity
  for the support of the theory of "Natural Selection."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when brought in merely to supplement and accentuate
  considerations and arguments derived from other sources, in that case
  difficulties connected with the geographical distribution of animals are
  not without significance, and are worthy of mention even though, by
  themselves, they constitute but feeble and more or less easily explicable
  puzzles which could not alone suffice either to sustain or to defeat any
  theory of specific origination.</p>

  <p>Many facts as to the present distribution of animal life over the
  world are very readily explicable by the hypothesis of slight elevations
  and depressions of larger and smaller parts of its surface, but there are
  others the existence of which it is much more difficult so to
  explain.</p>

  <p>The distribution either of animals possessing the power of flight, or
  of inhabitants of the ocean, is, of course, easily to be accounted for;
  the difficulty, if there is really any, must mainly be with strictly
  terrestrial animals of moderate or small powers of locomotion and with
  inhabitants of fresh water. Mr. Darwin himself observes,<a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> "In regard to fish, I believe that
  the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents."
  Now, the Author is enabled, by the labours and through the kindness of
  Dr. Günther, to show that this belief cannot be maintained; he having
  been so obliging as to call attention to the following facts with regard
  to fish-distribution. These facts show that though only one species which
  is absolutely and exclusively an inhabitant of fresh water is as yet
  known to be found in distant continents, yet that in several other
  instances the same species <i>is</i> found in the fresh water of distant
  continents, and that very often the same <i>genus</i> is so
  distributed.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Mastacembelus</i> belongs to a family of fresh-water <!--
  Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>[146]</span>Indian fishes. Eight species of this genus
  are described by Dr. Günther in his catalogue.<a name="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> These forms extend from Java and
  Borneo on the one hand, to Aleppo on the other. Nevertheless, a new
  species (<i>M. cryptacanthus</i>) has been described by the same
  author,<a name="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> which is an
  inhabitant of the Camaroon country of <i>Western</i> Africa. He observes,
  "The occurrence of Indian forms on the West Coast of Africa, such as
  <i>Periophthalmus</i>, <i>Psettus</i>, <i>Mastacembelus</i>, is of the
  highest interest, and an almost new fact in our knowledge of the
  geographical distribution of fishes."</p>

  <p><i>Ophiocephalus</i>, again, is a truly Indian genus, there being no
  less than twenty-five species,<a name="NtA_145"
  href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> all from the fresh waters of the East
  Indies. Yet Dr. Günther informs me that there is a species in the Upper
  Nile and in West Africa.</p>

  <p>The acanthopterygian family (<i>Labyrinthici</i>) contains nine
  freshwater genera, and these are distributed between the East Indies and
  South and Central Africa.</p>

  <p>The Carp fishes (Cyprinoids) are found in India, Africa, and
  Madagascar, but there are none in South America.</p>

  <p>Thus existing fresh-water fishes point to an immediate connexion
  between Africa and India, harmonizing with what we learn from Miocene
  mammalian remains.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Characinidæ (a family of the physostomous
  fishes) are found in Africa and South America, and not in India, and even
  its component groups are so distributed,&mdash;namely, the
  <i>Tetragonopterina</i><a name="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> and the <i>Hydrocyonina</i>.<a
  name="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Again, we have similar phenomena in that almost exclusively
  fresh-water group the Siluroids.</p>

  <p>Thus the genera <i>Clarias</i><a name="NtA_148"
  href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> and <i>Heterobranchus</i><a
  name="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> are found both <!--
  Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>in
  Africa and the East Indies. <i>Plotosus</i> is found in Africa, India,
  and Australia, and the species <i>P. anguillaris</i><a name="NtA_150"
  href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> has been brought from both China and
  Moreton Bay. Here, therefore, we have the same species in two distinct
  geographical regions. It is however a coast fish, which, though entering
  rivers, yet lives in the sea.</p>

  <p><i>Eutropius</i><a name="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>
  is an African genus, but <i>E. obtusirostris</i> comes from India. On the
  other hand, <i>Amiurus</i> is a North American form; but one species,
  <i>A. cantonensis</i>,<a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> comes from China.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Galaxias</i><a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> has at least one species common to
  New Zealand and South America, and one common to South America and
  Tasmania. In this genus we thus have an absolutely and completely
  fresh-water form <i>of the very same species</i> distributed between
  different and distinct geographical regions.</p>

  <p>Of the lower fishes, a lamprey, <i>Mordacia mordax</i>,<a
  name="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> is common to South
  Australia and Chile; while another form of the same family, namely,
  <i>Geotria chilensis</i>,<a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> is found not only in South America
  and Australia, but in New Zealand also. These fishes, however, probably
  pass part of their lives in the sea.</p>

  <p>We thus certainly have several species which <i>are</i> common to the
  fresh waters of distant continents, although it cannot be certainly
  affirmed that they are exclusively and entirely fresh-water fishes
  throughout all their lives except in the case of <i>Galaxias</i>.</p>

  <p>Existing forms point to a close union between South America and Africa
  on the one hand, and between South America, Australia, Tasmania, and New
  Zealand on the other; but these unions were not synchronous any more than
  the unions indicated between India and Australia, China and Australia,
  China and North America, and India and Africa.</p>

  <p>Pleurodont lizards are such as have the teeth attached by <!-- Page
  148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[148]</span>their
  sides to the inner surface of the jaw, in contradistinction to acrodont
  lizards, which have the bases of their teeth anchylosed to the summit of
  the margin of the jaw. Now pleurodont iguanian lizards abound in the
  South American region; but nowhere else, and are not as yet known to
  inhabit any part of the present continent of Africa. Yet pleurodont
  lizards, strange to say, are found in Madagascar. This is the more
  remarkable, inasmuch as we have no evidence yet of the existence in
  Madagascar of fresh-water fishes common to Africa and South America.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;">
      <a href="images/164.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/164.png"
      alt="Lower jaw of Pleurodont Lizard." title="Lower jaw of Pleurodont Lizard." /></a>
    INNER SIDE OF LOWER JAW OF PLEURODONT LIZARD.<br /> (Showing the teeth
    attached to the inner surface of its side.)
  </div>
  <p>Again, that remarkable island Madagascar is the home of very singular
  and special insectivorous beasts of the genera Centetes, Ericulus, and
  Echinops; while the only other member of the group to which they belong
  is Solenodon, which is a resident in the West Indian Islands, Cuba and
  Hayti. The connexion, however, between the West Indies and Madagascar
  must surely have been at a time when the great lemurine group was absent;
  for it is difficult to understand the spread of such a form as Solenodon,
  and at the same time the non-extension of the active lemurs, or their
  utter extirpation, in such a congenial locality as the West Indian
  Archipelago.</p>

  <p>The close connexion of South America and Australia is demonstrated (on
  the Darwinian theory), not only from the marsupial fauna of both, but
  also from the frogs and toads which respectively inhabit those regions. A
  truly remarkable similarity and parallelism exist, however, between
  certain of the <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span>same animals inhabiting South Western
  America and Europe. Thus Dr. Günther has described<a name="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> a frog from Chile by the name of
  cacotus, which singularly resembles the European bombinator.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
      <a href="images/165.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/165.png"
      alt="Solenodon." title="Solenodon." /></a>
    SOLENODON.
  </div>
  <p>Again of the salmons, two genera from South America, New Zealand, and
  Australia, are analogous to European salmons.</p>

  <p>In addition to this may be mentioned a quotation from Professor Dana,
  given by Mr. Darwin,<a name="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
  to the effect that "it is certainly a wonderful fact that New Zealand
  should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to Great Britain, its
  antipode, than to any other part of the world:" and Mr. Darwin adds "Sir
  J. Richardson also speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New
  Zealand, Tasmania, &amp;c. of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs
  me that twenty-five species of algæ are <!-- Page 150 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[150]</span>common to New Zealand
  and to Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical
  seas."</p>

  <p>Many more examples of the kind could easily be brought, but these must
  suffice. As to the last-mentioned cases Mr. Darwin explains them by the
  influence of the glacial epoch, which he would extend actually across the
  equator, and thus account, amongst other things, for the appearance in
  Chile of frogs having close genetic relations with European forms. But it
  is difficult to understand the persistence and preservation of such
  exceptional forms with the extirpation of all the others which probably
  accompanied them, if so great a migration of northern kinds had been
  occasioned by the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin candidly says,<a name="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> "I am far from supposing that all
  difficulties in regard to the distribution and affinities of the
  identical and allied species, which now live so widely separated in the
  north and south, and sometimes on the intermediate mountain-ranges, are
  removed." ... "We cannot say why certain species and not others have
  migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to
  new forms, whilst others have remained unaltered." Again he adds,
  "Various difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance, the
  occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points so
  enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but
  icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their
  dispersal. The existence, at these and other distant points of the
  southern hemisphere, of species which, though distinct, belong to genera
  exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case. Some of
  these species are so distinct that we cannot suppose that there has been
  time since the commencement of the last glacial period for their
  migration and subsequent modification to the necessary degree." Mr.
  Darwin goes on to account for these facts by the probable existence of a
  rich antarctic <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>[151]</span>flora in a warm period anterior to the
  last glacial epoch. There are indeed many reasons for thinking that a
  southern continent, rich in living forms, once existed. One such reason
  is the way in which struthious birds are, or have been, distributed
  around the antarctic region: as the ostrich in Africa, the rhea in South
  America, the emeu in Australia, the apteryx, dinornis, &amp;c. in New
  Zealand, the epiornis in Madagascar. Still the existence of such a land
  would not alone explain the various geographical cross relations which
  have been given above. It would not, for example, account for the
  resemblance between the crustacea or fishes of New Zealand and of
  England. It would, however, go far to explain the identity (specific or
  generic) between fresh water and other forms now simultaneously existing
  in Australia and South America, or in either or both of these, and New
  Zealand.</p>

  <p>Again, mutations of elevation small and gradual (but frequent and
  intermitting), through enormous periods of time&mdash;waves, as it were,
  of land rolling many times in many directions&mdash;might be made to
  explain many difficulties as to geographical distribution, and any cases
  that remained would probably be capable of explanation, as being isolated
  but allied animal forms, now separated indeed, but being merely remnants
  of extensive groups which, at an earlier period, were spread over the
  surface of the earth. Thus none of the facts here given are any serious
  difficulty to the doctrine of "evolution," but it is contended in this
  book that if other considerations render it improbable that the
  manifestation of the successive forms of life has been brought about by
  minute, indefinite, and fortuitous variations, then these facts as to
  geographical distribution intensify that improbability, and are so far
  worthy of attention.</p>

  <p>All geographical difficulties of the kind would be evaded if we could
  concede the probability of the independent origin, in different
  localities, of the same organic forms in animals high in <!-- Page 152
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>[152]</span>the scale of
  nature. Similar causes must produce similar results, and new reasons have
  been lately adduced for believing, as regards the <i>lowest
  organisms</i>, that the same forms can arise and manifest themselves
  independently. The difficulty as to higher animals is, however, much
  greater, as (on the theory of evolution) one acting force must always be
  the ancestral history in each case, and this force must always tend to go
  on acting in the same groove and direction in the future as it has in the
  past. So that it is difficult to conceive that individuals, the ancestral
  history of which is very different, can be acted upon by all influences,
  external and internal, in such diverse ways and proportions that the
  results (unequals being added to unequals) shall be equal and similar.
  Still, though highly improbable, this cannot be said to be impossible;
  and if there <i>is</i> an innate law of any kind helping to determine
  specific evolution, this may more or less, or entirely, neutralize or
  even reverse the effect of ancestral habit. Thus, it is quite conceivable
  that a pleurodont lizard might have arisen in Madagascar in perfect
  independence of the similarly-formed American lacertilia: just as certain
  teeth of carnivorous and insectivorous marsupial animals have been seen
  most closely to resemble those of carnivorous and insectivorous placental
  beasts; just as, again, the paddles of the Cetacea resemble, in the fact
  of a multiplication in the number of the phalanges, the many-jointed feet
  of extinct marine reptiles, and as the beak of the cuttle-fish or of the
  tadpole resembles that of birds. We have already seen (in Chapter III.)
  that it is impossible, upon any hypothesis, to escape admitting the
  independent origins of closely similar forms, It may be that they are
  both more frequent and more important than is generally thought.</p>

  <p>That closely similar structures may arise without a genetic
  relationship has been lately well urged by Mr. Ray Lankester.<a
  name="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span>He has brought this
  notion forward even as regards the bones of the skull in osseous fishes
  and in mammals. He has done so on the ground that the probable common
  ancestor of mammals and of osseous fishes was a vertebrate animal of so
  low a type that it could not be supposed to have possessed a skull
  differentiated into distinct bony elements&mdash;even if it was bony at
  all. If this was so, then the cranial bones must have had an independent
  origin in each class, and in this case we have the most strikingly
  harmonious and parallel results from independent actions. For the bones
  of the skull in an osseous fish are so closely conformed to those of a
  mammal, that "both types of skull exhibit many bones in common," though
  "in each type some of these bones acquire special arrangements and very
  different magnitudes."<a name="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> And no investigator of homologies
  doubts that a considerable number of the bones which form the skull of
  any osseous fish are distinctly homologous with the cranial bones of man.
  The occipital, the parietal, and frontal, the bones which surround the
  internal ear, the vomer, the premaxilla, and the quadrate bones, may be
  given as examples. Now, if such close relations of homology can be
  brought about independently of any but the most remote genetic affinity,
  it would be rash to affirm dogmatically that there is any impossibility
  in the independent origin of such forms as centetes and solenodon, or of
  genetically distinct batrachians, as similar to each other as are some of
  the frogs of South America and of Europe. At the same time such phenomena
  must at present be considered as very improbable, from the action of
  ancestral habit, as before stated.</p>

  <p>We have seen, then, that the geographical distribution of animals
  presents difficulties, though not insuperable ones, for the Darwinian
  hypothesis. If, however, other reasons against it appear of any
  weight&mdash;if, especially, there is reason to believe that geological
  <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>[154]</span>time has not been sufficient for it, then
  it will be well to bear in mind the facts here enumerated. These facts,
  however, are not opposed to the doctrine of evolution; and if it could be
  established that closely similar forms had really arisen in complete
  independence one of the other, they would rather tend to strengthen and
  to support that theory. <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Animals made-up of parts mutually related in various ways.&mdash;What
  homology is.&mdash;Its various kinds.&mdash;Serial
  homology.&mdash;Lateral homology.&mdash;Vertical homology.&mdash;Mr.
  Herbert Spencer's explanations.&mdash;An internal power necessary, as

  pathology.&mdash;Mr. James Paget.&mdash;Dr. William Budd.&mdash;The
  existence of such an internal power of individual development diminishes
  the improbability of an analogous law of specific origination.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That concrete whole which is spoken of as "an individual" (such,
  <i>e.g.</i>, as a bird or a lobster) is formed of a more or less complex
  aggregation of parts which are actually (from whatever cause or causes)
  grouped, together in a harmonious interdependency, and which have a
  multitude of complex relations amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>The mind detects a certain number of these relations as it
  contemplates the various component parts of an individual in one or other
  direction&mdash;as it follows up different lines of thought. These
  perceived relations, though subjective, <i>as relations</i>, have
  nevertheless an objective foundation as real parts, or conditions of
  parts, of real wholes; they are, therefore, true relations, such,
  <i>e.g.</i>, as those between the right and left hand, between the hand
  and the foot, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The component parts of each concrete whole have also a relation of
  resemblance to the parts of other concrete wholes, whether <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span>of the same or
  of different kinds, as the resemblance between the hands of two men, or
  that between the hand of a man and the fore-paw of a cat.</p>

  <p>Now, it is here contended that the relationships borne one to another
  by various component parts, imply the existence of some innate, internal
  condition, conveniently spoken of as a power or tendency, which is quite
  as mysterious as is any innate condition, power, or tendency, resulting
  in the orderly evolution of successive specific manifestations. These
  relationships, as also this developmental power, will doubtless, in a
  certain sense, be somewhat further explained as science advances. But the
  result will be merely a shifting of the inexplicability a point
  backwards, by the intercalation of another step between the action of the
  internal condition or power and its external result. In the meantime,
  even if by "Natural Selection" we could eliminate the puzzles of the
  "origin of species," yet other phenomena, not less remarkable (namely,
  those noticed in this chapter), would still remain unexplained and as yet
  inexplicable. It is not improbable that, could we arrive at the causes
  conditioning all the complex inter-relations between the several parts of
  one animal, we should at the same time obtain the key to unlock the
  secrets of specific origination.</p>

  <p>It is desirable, then, to see what facts there are in animal
  organization which point to innate conditions (powers and tendencies), as
  yet unexplained, and upon which the theory of "Natural Selection" is
  unable to throw any explanatory light.</p>

  <p>The facts to be considered are the phenomena of "homology," and
  especially of serial, bilateral, and vertical homology.</p>

  <p>The word "homology" indicates such a relation between two parts that
  they may be said in some sense to be "the same," or at least "of similar
  nature." This similarity, however, does not relate to the <i>use</i> to
  which parts are put, but only to their relative position with regard to
  other parts, or to their <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>[157]</span>mode of origin. There are many kinds of
  homology,<a name="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> but it is
  only necessary to consider the three kinds above enumerated.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

    WINGBONES OF PTERODACTYLE, BAT, AND BIRD.
  </div>
  <p>The term "homologous" may be applied to parts in two individual
  animals of different kinds, or to different parts of the same individual.
  Thus "the right and left hands," or "joints of the backbone," or "the
  teeth of the two jaws," are homologous parts of the same individual. But
  the arm of a man, the fore-leg of the horse, the paddle of the whale, and
  the wing of the bat and the bird are all also homologous parts, yet of
  another kind, <i>i.e.</i> they are the same parts existing in animals of
  different species.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the wing of the humming-bird and the wing of the
  humming-bird moth are not homologous at all, or in any sense; for the
  resemblance between them consists solely in the use to which they are
  put, and is therefore only a relation of <i>analogy</i>. There is no
  relation of <i>homology</i> between them, because they have no common
  resemblance as to their relations to surrounding parts, or as to their
  mode of origin. Similarly, <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>[158]</span>there is no homology between the wing of
  the bat and that of the flying-dragon, for the latter is formed of
  certain ribs, and not of limb bones.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Homology may be further distinguished into (1) a relationship which,
  on evolutionary principles, would be due to descent from a common
  ancestor, as the homological relation between the arm-bone of the horse
  and that of the ox, or between the singular ankle bones of the two
  lemurine genera, cheirogaleus and galago, and which relation has been
  termed by Mr. Ray Lankester "homogeny;"<a name="NtA_162"
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> and (2) a relationship induced, not
  derived&mdash;such as exists between parts closely similar in relative
  position, but with no genetic affinity, or only a remote one, as the
  homological relation between the chambers of the heart of a <!-- Page 159
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>bat and those
  of a bird, or the similar teeth of the thylacine and the dog before
  spoken of. For this relationship Mr. Bay Lankester has proposed the term
  "homoplasy."</p>

  </div>
  <p>"Serial homology" is a relation of resemblance existing between two or
  more parts placed in series one behind the other in the same individual.
  Examples of such homologues are the ribs, <!-- Page 160 --><span

  backbone of a horse, or the limbs of a centipede. The latter animal is a
  striking example of serial homology. The body (except at its two ends)
  consists of a longitudinal series of similar segments. Each segment
  supports a pair of limbs, and the appendages of all the segments (except
  as before) are completely alike.</p>

    SQUILLA.
  </div>
  <p>A less complete case of serial homology is presented by Crustacea
  (animals of the crab class), notably by the squilla and by the common
  lobster. In the latter animal we have a <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[161]</span>six-jointed abdomen
  (the so-called tail), in front of which is a large solid mass (the
  cephalo-thorax), terminated anteriorly by a jointed process (the
  rostrum). On the under surface of the body we find a quantity of moveable
  appendages. Such are, <i>e.g.</i>, feelers (Fig. 9), jaws (Figs. 6, 7,
  and 8), foot-jaws (Fig. 5), claws and legs (Figs. 3 and 4), beneath the
  cephalo-thorax; and flat processes (Fig. 2), called "swimmerets," beneath
  the so-called tail or abdomen.</p>

  <p>Now, these various appendages are distinct and different <!-- Page 162
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>[162]</span>enough as we
  see them in the adult, but they all appear in the embryo as buds of
  similar form and size, and the thoracic limbs at first consist each of
  two members, as the swimmerets always do.</p>

  <p>This shows what great differences may exist in size, in form, and in
  function, between parts which are developmentally the same, for all these
  appendages are modifications of one common kind of structure, which
  becomes differently modified in different situations; in other words,
  they are serial homologues.</p>

  <p>The segments of the body, as they follow one behind the other, are
  also serially alike, as is plainly seen in the abdomen or tail. In the
  cephalo-thorax of the lobster, however, this is disguised. It is
  therefore very interesting to find that in the other crustacean before
  mentioned, the squilla, the segmentation of the body is more completely
  preserved, and even the first three segments, which go to compose the
  head, remain permanently distinct.</p>

    SPINE OF GALAGO ALLENII.
  </div>
  <p>Such an obvious and unmistakeable serial repetition of parts does not
  obtain in the highest, or backboned animals, the Vertebrata. Thus in man
  and other mammals, nothing of the kind is <i>externally</i> visible, and
  we have to penetrate to his skeleton to find such a series of homologous
  parts.</p>

  <p>There, indeed, we discover a number of pairs of bones, each pair so
  obviously resembling the others, that they all receive a common
  name&mdash;the ribs. There also (<i>i.e.</i> in the skeleton) we find a
  still more remarkable series of similar parts, the joints of the spine or
  backbone (vertebræ), which are admitted by all to possess a certain
  community of structure. <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page163"></a>[163]</span></p>

  <p>It is in their limbs, however, that the Vertebrata present the most
  obvious and striking serial homology&mdash;almost the only serial
  homology noticeable externally.</p>

  <p>The facts of serial homology seem hardly to have excited the amount of
  interest they certainly merit.</p>

  <p>Very many writers, indeed, have occupied themselves with
  investigations and speculations as to what portions of the leg and foot
  answer to what parts of the arm and hand, a question which has only
  recently received a more or less satisfactory solution through the
  successive concordant efforts of Professor Humphry,<a name="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> Professor Huxley,<a name="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> the Author of this work,<a
  name="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> and Professor
  Flower.<a name="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> Very few
  writers, however, have devoted much time or thought to the question of
  serial homology in general. Mr. Herbert Spencer, indeed, in his very
  interesting "First Principles of Biology," has given forth ideas on this
  subject, which are well worthy careful perusal and consideration, and
  some of which apply also to the other kinds of homology mentioned above.
  He would explain the serial homologies of such creatures as the lobster
  and centipede thus: Animals of a very low grade propagate themselves by
  spontaneous fission. If certain creatures found benefit from this process
  of division remaining incomplete, such creatures (on the theory of
  "Natural Selection") would transmit their selected tendency to such
  incomplete division to their posterity. In this way, it is conceivable,
  that animals might arise in the form of long chains of similar segments,
  each of which chains would consist of a number of imperfectly separated
  individuals, and be equivalent to a series of separate individuals
  belonging to kinds in which the fission was complete. In other words, Mr.
  <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>[164]</span>Spencer would explain it as the
  coalescence of organisms of a lower degree of aggregation in one
  longitudinal series, through survival of the fittest aggregations. This
  may be so. It is certainly an ingenious speculation, but facts have not
  yet been brought forward which demonstrate it. Had they been so, this
  kind of serial homology might be termed "homogenetic."</p>

  <p>The other kind of serial repetitions, namely, those of the vertebral
  column, are explained by Mr. Spencer as the results of alternate strains
  and compressions acting on a primitively homogeneous cylinder. The serial
  homology of the fore and hind limbs is explained by the same writer as
  the result of a similarity in the influences and conditions to which they
  are exposed. Serial homologues so formed might be called, as Mr. Ray
  Lankester has proposed, "homoplastic." But there are, it is here
  contended, abundant reasons for thinking that the predominant agent in
  the production of the homologies of the limbs is an <i>internal</i> force
  or tendency. And if such a power can be shown to be necessary in this
  instance, it may also be legitimately used to explain such serial
  homologies as those of the centipede's segments and of the joints of the
  backbone. At the same time it is not, of course, pretended that external
  conditions do not contribute their own effects in addition. The presence
  of this internal power will be rendered more probable if valid arguments
  can be brought forward against the explanations which Mr. Herbert Spencer
  has offered.</p>

  <p><i>Lateral homology</i> (or bilateral symmetry) is the resemblance
  between the right and left sides of an animal, or of part of an animal;
  as, <i>e.g.</i>, between our right hand and our left. It exists more or
  less at one or other time of life in all animals, except some very lowly
  organized creatures. In the highest animals this symmetry is laid down at
  the very dawn of life, the first trace of the future creature being a
  longitudinal streak&mdash;the embryonic "primitive groove." This kind of
  homology is explained by Mr. Spencer as the result of the similar <!--
  Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>[165]</span>way
  in which conditions affect the right and left sides respectively.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:12%;">

      alt="Vertebrae of Axolotl." title="Vertebrae of Axolotl." /></a>
    VERTEBRÆ OF AXOLOTL.
  </div>
  <p><i>Vertical homology</i> (or vertical symmetry) is the resemblance
  existing between parts which are placed one above the other beneath. It
  is much less general and marked than serial, or lateral homology.
  Nevertheless, it is plainly to be seen in the tail region of most fishes,
  and in the far-extending dorsal (back) and ventral (belly) fins of such
  kinds as the sole and the flounder.</p>

  <p>It is also strikingly shown in the bones of the tail of certain efts,
  as in <i>Chioglossa</i>, where the complexity of the upper (neural) arch
  is closely repeated by the inferior one. Again, in <i>Spelerpes
  rubra</i>, where almost vertically ascending articular processes above
  are repeated by almost vertically descending articular processes below.
  Also in the axolotl, where there are douple pits, placed side by side,
  not only superiorly but at the same time inferiorly.<a name="NtA_167"
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This kind of homology is also explained by Mr. Spencer as the result
  of the similarity of conditions affecting the two parts. Thus he explains
  the very general absence of symmetry between the dorsal and ventral
  surfaces of animals by the different conditions to which these two
  surfaces are respectively exposed, and in the same way he explains the
  asymmetry of the flat-fishes (<i>Pleuronectidæ</i>), of snails,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Now, first, as regards Mr. Spencer's explanation of animal forms by
  means of the influence of external conditions, the following observations
  may be made. Abundant instances are brought forward by him of admirable
  adaptation of structure to circumstances, but as to the immense majority
  of these it is very difficult, if not impossible, to see <i>how</i>
  external <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>[166]</span>conditions can have produced, or even
  tended to have produced them. For example, we may take the migration of
  one eye of the sole to the other side of its head. What is there here
  either in the darkness, or the friction, or in any other conceivable
  external cause, to have produced the first beginning of such an
  unprecedented displacement of the eye? Mr. Spencer has beautifully
  illustrated that correlation which all must admit to exist between the
  forms of organisms and their surrounding external conditions, but by no
  means proved that the latter are <i>the cause</i> of the former.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Some internal conditions (or in ordinary language some internal power
  and force) must be conceded to living organisms, otherwise incident
  forces must act upon them and upon non-living aggregations of matter in
  the same way and with similar effects.</p>

  <p>If the mere presence of these incident forces produces so ready a
  response in animals and plants, it must be that there are, in their case,
  conditions disposing and enabling them so to respond, according to the
  old maxim, <i>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis</i>, as
  the same rays of light which bleach a piece of silk, blacken nitrate of
  silver. If, therefore, we <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>[167]</span>attribute the forms of organisms to the
  action of external conditions, <i>i.e.</i> of incident forces on their
  modifiable structure, we give but a partial account of the matter,
  removing a step back, as it were, the action of the internal condition,
  power, or force which must be conceived as occasioning such ready
  modifiability. But indeed it is not at all easy to see how the influence
  of the surface of the ground or any conceivable condition or force can
  produce the difference which exists between the ventral and dorsal
  shields of the carapace of a tortoise, or by what differences of merely
  external causes the ovaries of the two sides of the body can be made
  equal in a bat and unequal in a bird.</p>

    AN ECHINUS, OR SEA-URCHIN.<br /> (The spines removed from
    one-half.)
  </div>
  <p>There is, on the other hand, an <i>a priori</i> reason why we should
  expect to find that the symmetrical forms of all animals are due to
  internal causes. This reason is the fact that the symmetrical forms of
  minerals are undoubtedly due to such causes. It is unnecessary here to do
  more than allude to the beautiful and complex forms presented by
  inorganic structures. With regard to organisms, however, the wonderful
  Acanthometræ and the Polycystina may be mentioned as presenting
  complexities of form which can hardly be thought to be due to other than
  <i>internal</i> causes. The same may be said of the great group of <!--
  Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>[168]</span>Echinoderms, with their amazing variety of
  component parts. If then internal forces can so build up the most varied
  structures, they are surely capable of producing the serial, lateral, and
  vertical symmetries which higher animal forms exhibit. Mr. Spencer is the
  more bound to admit this, inasmuch as in his doctrine of "physiological
  units" he maintains that these organic atoms of his have an innate power
  of building up and evolving the whole and perfect animal from which they
  were in each case derived. To build up and evolve the various symmetries
  here spoken of is not one whit more mysterious. Directly to refute Mr.
  Spencer's assertion, however, would require the bringing forward of
  examples of organisms which are ill-adapted to their positions, and out
  of harmony with their surroundings&mdash;a difficult task indeed.<a
  name="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Secondly, as regards the last-mentioned author's explanation of such
  serial homology as exists in the centipede and its allies, the very
  groundwork is open to objection. Multiplication by spontaneous fission
  seems from some recent researches to be much less frequent than has been
  supposed, and more evidence is required as to the fact of the habitual
  propagation of <i>any</i> planariæ in this fashion.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> But even if this were as asserted,
  <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>[169]</span>nevertheless it fails to explain the
  peculiar condition presented by <i>Syllis</i> and some other annelids,
  where a new head is formed at intervals in certain segments of the body.
  Here there is evidently an innate tendency to the development at
  intervals of a complex whole. It is not the budding out or spontaneous
  fission of certain segments, but the transformation in a definite and
  very peculiar manner of parts which already exist into other and more
  complex parts. Again, the processes of development presented by some of
  these creatures do not by any means point <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[170]</span>to an origin through
  the linear coalescence of primitively distinct animals by means of
  imperfect segmentation. Thus in certain Diptera (two winged flies) the
  legs, wings, eyes, &amp;c., are derived from masses of formative tissue
  (termed imaginal disks), which by their mutual approximation together
  build up parts of the head and body,<a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> recalling to mind the development of
  Echinoderms.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">

      alt="An Annelid dividing." title="An Annelid dividing." /></a>
    AN ANNELID DIVIDING SPONTANEOUSLY.<br /> (A new head having been formed
    towards the hinder end of the body of the parent.)
  </div>
  <p>Again, Nicholas Wagner found in certain other Diptera, the Hessian
  flies, that the larva gives rise to secondary larvæ within it, which
  develop and burst the body of the primary larva. The secondary larvæ give
  rise, similarly, to another set within them, and these again to another<a
  name="NtA_171" href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> set.</p>

  <p>Again, the fact that in <i>Tænia echinococcus</i> one egg produces
  numerous individuals, tends to invalidate the argument that the increase
  of segments during development is a relic of specific genesis.</p>

  <p>Mr. H. Spencer seems to deny serial homology to the mollusca, but it
  is difficult to see why the shell segments of chiton are not such
  homologues because the segmentation is superficial. Similarly the
  external processes of eolis, doris, &amp;c., are good examples of serial
  homology, as also are plainly the successive chambers of the
  orthoceratidæ. Nor are parts of a series less serial, because arranged
  spirally, as in most gasteropods. Mr. Spencer observes of the molluscous
  as of the vertebrate animal, "You cannot cut it into transverse slices,
  each of which contains a digestive organ, a respiratory organ, a
  reproductive organ, &amp;c."<a name="NtA_172"
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> But the same may be said of every
  single arthropod and annelid if it be meant that all these organs are not
  contained in every possible slice. While if it be meant that parts of all
  such organs are contained in certain slices, then some of the mollusca
  may also be included.</p>

  <p>Another objection to Mr. Spencer's speculation is derived from
  considerations which have already been stated, as to past <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>[171]</span>time. For if
  the annulose animals have been formed by aggregation, we ought to find
  this process much less perfect in the oldest form. But a complete
  development, such as already obtains in the lobster, &amp;c., was reached
  by the Eurypterida and Trilobites of the palæozoic strata; and annelids,
  probably formed mainly like those of the present day, abounded during the
  deposition of the oldest fossiliferous rocks.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/151.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/151.png"
      alt="Trilobite." title="Trilobite." /></a>
    TRILOBITE.
  </div>
  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, as regards such serial homology as is exemplified
  by the backbone of man, there are also several objections to Mr.
  Spencer's mechanical explanation.</p>

  <p>On the theory of evolution most in favour, the first Vertebrata were
  aquatic. Now, as natation is generally effected by repeated and vigorous
  lateral flexions of the body, we ought to find the segmentation much more
  complete laterally than on the dorsal and ventral aspects of the spinal
  column. Nevertheless, in those species which, taken together, constitute
  a series of more and more distinctly segmented forms, the segmentation
  gradually increases <i>all round</i> the central part of the spinal
  column.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer<a name="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a>
  thinks it probable that the sturgeon has retained the notochordal (that
  is, the primitive, unsegmented) structure <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>[172]</span>because it is sluggish.
  But Dr. Günther informs me that the sluggishness of the common tope
  (<i>Galeus vulgaris</i>) is much like that of the sturgeon, and yet the
  bodies of its vertebræ are distinct and well-ossified. Moreover, the
  great salamander of Japan is much more inert and sluggish than either,
  and yet it has a well-developed, bony spine.</p>

  <p>I can learn nothing of the habits of the sharks <i>Hexanchus</i>,
  <i>Heptanchus</i>, and <i>Echinorhinus</i>, but Müller describes them as
  possessing a persistent <i>chorda dorsalis</i>.<a name="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> It may be they have the habits of the
  tope, but other sharks are amongst the very swiftest and most active of
  fishes.</p>

  <p>In the bony pike (<i>lepidosteus</i>), the rigidity of the bony scales
  by which it is completely enclosed must prevent any excessive flexion of
  the body, and yet its vertebral column presents a degree of ossification
  and vertebral completeness greater than that found in any other fish
  whatever.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer supports his argument by the non-segmentation of the
  anterior end of the skeletal axis, <i>i.e.</i> by the non-segmentation of
  the skull. But in fact the skull <i>is</i> segmented, and, according to
  the quasi-vertebral theory of the skull put forward by Professor
  Huxley,<a name="NtA_175" href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> is probably
  formed of a number of coalesced segments, of some of which the trabeculæ
  cranii and the mandibular and hyoidean arches are indications. What is,
  perhaps, most remarkable however is, that the segmentation of the
  skull&mdash;its separation into the three occipital, parietal, and
  frontal elements&mdash;is most complete and distinct in the highest
  class, and this can have nothing, however remotely, to do with the cause
  suggested by Mr. Spencer.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, there is something to be said in opposition to both the
  aggregational and the mechanical explanations of serial homology. The
  explanations suggested are very ingenious, yet <!-- Page 173 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>[173]</span>repose upon a very
  small basis of fact. Not but that the process of vertebral segmentation
  may have been sometimes assisted by the mechanical action suggested.</p>

  <p>It remains now to consider what are the evidences in support of the
  existence of an internal power, by the action of which these homological
  manifestations are evolved. It is here contended that there <i>is</i>
  good evidence of the existence of some such special internal power, and
  that not only from facts of comparative anatomy, but also from those of
  teratology<a name="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> and
  pathology. These facts appear to show, not only that there are
  homological internal relations, but that they are so strong and energetic
  as to re-assert and re-exhibit themselves in creatures which, on the
  Darwinian theory, are the descendants of others in which they were much
  less marked. They are, in fact, sometimes even more plain and distinct in
  animals of the highest types than in inferior forms, and, moreover, this
  deep-seated tendency acts even in diseased and abnormal conditions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin recognizes<a name="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> these homological relations, and does
  "not doubt that they may be mastered more or less completely by Natural
  Selection." He does not, however, give any explanation of these phenomena
  other than the imposition on them of the name "laws of correlation;" and
  indeed he says, "The nature of the bond of correlation is frequently
  quite obscure." Now, it is surely more desirable to make use, if
  possible, of one conception than to imagine a number of, to all
  appearance, separate and independent "laws of correlation" between
  different parts of each animal.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">

    THE PANGOLIN (MANIS).
  </div>
  <p>But even some of these alleged laws hardly appear well founded. Thus
  Mr. Darwin, in support of such a law of concomitant variation as regards
  hair and teeth, brings forward the <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[174]</span>case of Julia
  Pastrana,<a name="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> and a man
  of the Burmese Court, and adds,<a name="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> "These cases and those of the
  hairless dogs forcibly call to mind the fact that the two orders of
  mammals, namely, the Edentata and Cetacea, which are the most abnormal in
  their dermal covering, are likewise the most abnormal either by
  deficiency or redundancy of teeth." The assertion with regard to these
  orders is certainly true, but it should be borne in mind at the same time
  that the armadillos, which are much more abnormal than are the American
  anteaters as regards their dermal covering, in their dentition are less
  so. The Cape ant-eater, on the other hand, the Aard-vark (Orycteropus),
  has teeth formed on a type quite different from that existing in any
  other mammal; yet its hairy coat is not known to exhibit any such strange
  peculiarity. Again, those remarkable scaly ant-eaters of the Old
  World&mdash;the pangolins (Manis)&mdash;stand alone amongst mammals as
  <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>[175]</span>regards their dermal covering; having been
  classed with lizards by early naturalists on account of their clothing of
  scales, yet their mouth is like that of the hairy ant-eaters of the New
  World. On the other hand, the duck-billed platypus of Australia
  (Ornithorhynchus) is the only mammal which has teeth formed of horn, yet
  its furry coat is normal and ordinary. Again, the Dugong and Manatee are
  dermally alike, yet extremely different as regards the structure and
  number of their teeth. The porcupine also, in spite of its enormous
  armature of quills, is furnished with as good a supply of teeth as are
  the hairy members of the same family, but not with a better one; and in
  spite of the deficiency of teeth in the hairless dogs, no converse
  redundancy of teeth has, it is believed, been remarked in Angora cats and
  rabbits. To <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page176"></a>[176]</span>say the least, then, this law of
  correlation presents numerous and remarkable exceptions.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">

      alt="Dugong." title="Dugong." /></a>
    DUGONG.
  </div>
  <p>To return, however, to the subject of homological relations: it is
  surely inconceivable that indefinite variation with survival of the
  fittest can ever have built up these serial, bilateral, and vertical
  homologies, without the action of some special innate power or tendency
  so to build up, possessed by the organism itself in each case. By
  "special tendency" is meant one the laws and conditions of which are as
  yet unknown, but which is analogous to the innate power and tendency
  possessed by crystals similarly, to build up certain peculiar and very
  definite forms.</p>

  <p>First, with regard to comparative anatomy. The correspondence between
  the thoracic and pelvic limbs is notorious. Professor Gegenbaur has
  lately endeavoured<a name="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>
  to explain this resemblance by the derivation of each limb from a
  primitive form of fin. This fin is supposed to have had a marginal
  external (radial) series of cartilages, each of which supported a series
  of secondary cartilages, starting from the inner (ulnar) side of the
  distal part of the supporting marginal piece. The root marginal piece
  would become the humerus or femur, as the case might be: the second
  marginal piece, with the piece attached to the inner side of the distal
  end of the root marginal piece, would together form either the radius and
  ulna or the tibia and fibula, and so on.</p>

  <p>Now there is little doubt (from <i>a priori</i> considerations) but
  that the special differentiation of the limb bones of the higher
  Vertebrates has been evolved from anterior conditions existing in some
  fish-like form or other. But the particular view advocated by the learned
  Professor is open to criticism. Thus, it may be objected against this
  view, first, that it takes no account of the radial ossicle which becomes
  so enormous in the mole; secondly, that it does not explain the extra
  series of <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>[177]</span>ossicles which are formed on the
  <i>outer</i> (radial or marginal) side of the paddle in the
  Ichthyosaurus; and thirdly, and most importantly, that even if this had
  been the way in which the limbs had been differentiated, it would not be
  at all inconsistent with the possession of an innate power of producing,
  and an innate tendency to produce similar and symmetrical homological
  resemblances. It would not be so because resemblances of the kind are
  found to exist, which, on the Darwinian theory, must be subsequent and
  secondary, not primitive and ancestral. Thus we find in animals of the
  eft kind (certain amphibians), in which the tarsus is cartilaginous, that
  the carpus is cartilaginous likewise. And we shall see in cases of
  disease and of malformation what a tendency there is to a similar
  affection of homologous parts. In efts, as Professor Gegenbaur himself
  has pointed out,<a name="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a>
  there is a striking correspondence between the bones or cartilages
  supporting the arm, wrist, and fingers, and those sustaining the leg,
  ankle, and toes, with the exception that the toes exceed the fingers in
  number by one.</p>

  <p>Yet these animals are far from being the root-forms from which all the
  Vertebrata have diverged, as is evidenced from the degree of
  specialization which their structure presents. If they have <!-- Page 178
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[178]</span>descended from
  such primitive forms as Professor Gegenbaur imagines, then they have
  built up a secondary serial homology&mdash;a repetition of similar
  modifications&mdash;fully as remarkable as if it were primary. The
  Plesiosauria&mdash;those extinct marine reptiles of the Secondary period,
  with long necks, small heads, and paddle-like limbs&mdash;are of yet
  higher organization than are the efts and other Amphibia. Nevertheless
  they present us with a similarity of structure between the fore and hind
  limb, which is so great <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>[179]</span>as almost to be identity. But the Amphibia
  and Plesiosauria, though not themselves primitive vertebrate types, may
  be thought by some to have derived their limb-structure by direct descent
  from such. Tortoises, however, must be admitted to be not only highly
  differentiated organisms, but to be far indeed removed from primeval
  vertebrate structure. Yet certain tortoises<a name="NtA_182"
  href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> (notably <i>Chelydra Temminckii</i>)
  exhibit such a remarkable uniformity in fore and hind limb structure
  (extending even up to the proximal ends of the humerus and femur) that it
  is impossible to doubt its independent development in these forms.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Professor Burt G. Wilder, in his paper on extra digits,<a
  name="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> has <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>recorded no
  less than twenty-four cases where such excess coexisted in both little
  fingers; also one case in which the right little finger and little toe
  were so affected; six in which it was both the little fingers and both
  the little toes; and twenty-two other cases more or less the same, but in
  which the details were not accurately to be obtained.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin cites<a name="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>
  a remarkable instance of what he is inclined to regard as the development
  in the foot of birds of a sort of representation of the wing-feathers of
  the hand. He says: "In several distinct breeds of the pigeon and fowl the
  legs and the two outer toes are heavily feathered, so that, in the
  trumpeter pigeon, they appear like little wings. In the feather-legged
  bantam, the 'boots,' or feathers, which grow from the outside of the leg,
  and generally from the two outer toes, have, according to the excellent
  authority of Mr. Hewitt, been seen to exceed the wing-feathers in length,
  and in one case were actually nine and a half inches in length! As Mr.
  Blyth has remarked to me, these leg-feathers resemble the primary
  wing-feathers, and are totally unlike the fine down which naturally grows
  on the legs of some birds, such as grouse and owls. Hence it may be
  suspected that excess of food has first given redundancy to the plumage,
  and then that the law of homologous variation has led to the development
  of feathers on the legs, in a position corresponding with those on the
  wing, namely, on the outside of the tarsi and toes. I am strengthened in
  this belief by the following curious case of correlation, which for a
  long time seemed to me utterly inexplicable,&mdash;namely, that in
  pigeons of any breed, if the legs are feathered, the two outer toes are
  partially connected by skin. These two outer toes correspond with our
  third and fourth toes. Now, in the wing of the pigeon, or any other bird,
  the first and fifth digits are wholly aborted; the second is rudimentary,
  and carries the so-called 'bastard wing;' whilst the third and fourth
  <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>[182]</span>digits are completely united and enclosed
  by skin, together forming the extremity of the wing. So that in
  feather-footed pigeons not only does the exterior surface support a row
  of long feathers like wing-feathers, but the very same digits which in
  the wing are completely united by skin become partially united by skin in
  the feet; and thus, by the law of the correlated variation of homologous
  parts, we can understand the curious connexion of feathered legs and
  membrane between the outer toes."</p>

  <p>Irregularities in the circulating system are far from uncommon, and
  sometimes illustrate this homological tendency. My friend and colleague
  Mr. George G. Gascoyen, assistant surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital, has
  supplied me with two instances of symmetrical affections which have come
  under his observation.</p>

  <p>In the first of these the brachial artery bifurcated almost at its
  origin, the two halves re-uniting at the elbow-joint, and then dividing
  into the radial and ulnar arteries in the usual manner. In the second
  case an aberrant artery was given off from the radial side of the
  brachial artery, again almost at its origin. This aberrant artery
  anastomosed below the elbow-joint with the radial side of the radial
  artery. In each of these cases the right and left sides varied in
  precisely the same manner.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, as to pathology. Mr. James Paget,<a name="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> speaking of symmetrical diseases,
  says: "A certain morbid change of structure on one side of the body is
  repeated in the exactly corresponding part of the other side." He then
  quotes and figures a diseased lion's pelvis from the College of Surgeons
  Museum, and says of it: "Multiform as the pattern is in which the new
  bone, the product of some disease comparable with a human rheumatism, is
  deposited&mdash;a pattern more complex and irregular than the spots upon
  a map&mdash;there is not one spot or line on one side which is not
  represented, as exactly as it would be in a mirror, on the other. The
  likeness has more than <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span>daguerreotype exactness." He goes on to
  observe: "I need not describe many examples of such diseases. Any
  out-patients' room will furnish abundant instances of exact symmetry in
  the eruptions of eczema, lepra, and psoriasis; in the deformities of
  chronic rheumatism, the paralyses from lead; in the eruptions excited by
  iodide of potassium or copaiba. And any large museum will contain
  examples of equal symmetry in syphilitic ulcerations of the skull; in
  rheumatic and syphilitic deposits on the tibiæ and other bones; in all
  the effects of chronic rheumatic arthritis, whether in the bones, the
  ligaments, or the cartilages; in the fatty and earthy deposits in the
  coats of arteries."<a name="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

  <p>He also considered it to be proved that, "Next to the parts which are
  symmetrically placed, none are so nearly identical in composition as
  those which are homologous. For example, the backs of the hands and of
  the feet, or the palms and soles, are often not only symmetrically, but
  similarly, affected with psoriasis. So are the elbows and the knees; and
  similar portions of the thighs and the arms may be found affected with
  ichthyosis. Sometimes also specimens of fatty and earthy deposits in the
  arteries occur, in which exact similarity is shown in the plan, though
  not in the degree, with which the disease affects severally the humeral
  and femoral, the radial and peroneal, the ulnar and posterior tibial
  arteries."</p>

  <p>Dr. William Budd<a name="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>
  gives numerous instances of symmetry in disease, both lateral and serial.
  Thus, amongst others, we have one case (William Godfrey), in which the
  hands and feet were distorted. "The distortion of the right hand is
  greater than that of the left, of the right foot greater than that of the
  left foot." In another (Elizabeth Alford) lepra affected the extensor
  surfaces of the thoracic and pelvic limbs. Again, in the case of skin
  disease illustrated in Plate III., "The analogy between <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[184]</span>the elbows and
  knees is clearly expressed in the fact that these were the only parts
  affected with the disease."<a name="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Professor Burt Wilder,<a name="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> in his paper on "Pathological
  Polarities," strongly supports the philosophical importance of these
  peculiar relations, adding arguments in favour of antero-posterior
  homologies, which it is here unnecessary to discuss, enough having been
  said, it is believed, to thoroughly demonstrate the existence of these
  deep internal relations which are named lateral and serial
  homologies.</p>

  <p>What explanation can be offered of these phenomena? To say that they
  exhibit a "nutritional relation" brought about by a "balancing of forces"
  is merely to give a new denomination to the unexplained fact. The changes
  are, <i>of course</i>, brought about by a "nutritional" process, and the
  symmetry is undoubtedly the result of a "balance of forces," but to say
  so is a truism. The question is, what is the cause of this "nutritional
  balancing"? It is here contended that it must be due to an internal cause
  which at present science is utterly incompetent to explain. It is an
  internal property possessed by each living organic whole as well as by
  each non-living crystalline mass, and that there is such internal power
  or tendency, which may be spoken of as a "polarity," seems to be
  demonstrated by the instances above given, which can easily be multiplied
  indefinitely. Mr. Herbert Spencer<a name="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> (speaking of the reproduction, by
  budding, of a Begonia-leaf) recognizes a power of the kind. He says, "We
  have, therefore, no alternative but to say that the living particles
  composing one of these fragments have an innate tendency to arrange
  themselves into the shape of the organism to which they belong. We must
  infer that a plant or animal of any species is made up of special units,
  in all of which there dwells the intrinsic <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span>aptitude to aggregate
  into the form of that species; just as in the atoms of a salt, there
  dwells the intrinsic aptitude to crystallize in a particular way. It
  seems difficult to conceive that this can be so; but we see that it
  <i>is</i> so." ... "For this property there is no fit term. If we accept
  the word polarity as a name for the force by which inorganic units are
  aggregated into a form peculiar to them, we may apply this word to the
  analogous force displayed by organic limits."</p>

  <p>Dr. Jeffries Wyman,<a name="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> in his paper on the "Symmetry and
  Homology of Limbs," has a distinct chapter on the "Analogy between
  Symmetry and Polarity," illustrating it by the effects of magnets on
  "particles in a polar condition."</p>

  <p>Mr. J. J. Murphy, after noticing<a name="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> the power which crystals have to
  repair injuries inflicted on them and the modifications they undergo
  through the influence of the medium in which they may be formed, goes on
  to say:<a name="NtA_198" href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> "It needs no
  proof that in the case of spheres and crystals the forms and the
  structures are the effect, and not the cause, of the formative
  principles. Attraction, whether gravitative or capillary, produces the
  spherical form; the spherical form does not produce attraction. And
  crystalline polarities produce crystalline structure and form;
  crystalline structure and form do not produce crystalline polarities. The
  same is not quite so evident of organic forms, but it is equally true of
  them also." ... "It is not conceivable that the microscope should reveal
  peculiarities of structure corresponding to peculiarities of habitual
  tendency in the embryo, which at its first formation has no structure
  whatever;"<a name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> and he
  adds that "there is something quite inscrutable and mysterious" in the
  formation of a new individual <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>[186]</span>from the germinal matter of the embryo. In
  another place<a name="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> he
  says: "We know that in crystals, notwithstanding the variability of form
  within the limits of the same species, there are definite and very
  peculiar formative laws, which cannot possibly depend on anything like
  organic functions, because crystals have no such functions; and it ought
  not to surprise us if there are similar formative or morphological laws
  among organisms, which, like the formative laws of crystallization,
  cannot be referred to any relation of form or structure to function.
  Especially, I think, is this true of the lowest organisms, many of which
  show great beauty of form, of a kind that appears to be altogether due to
  symmetry of growth; as the beautiful star-like rayed forms of the
  <i>acanthometræ</i>, which are low animal organisms not very different
  from the Foraminifera." Their "definiteness of form does not appear to be
  accompanied by any corresponding differentiation of function between
  different parts; and, so far as I can see, the beautiful regularity and
  symmetry of their radiated forms are altogether due to unknown laws of
  symmetry of growth, just like the equally beautiful and somewhat similar
  forms of the compound six-rayed, star-shaped crystals of snow."</p>

  <p>Altogether, then, it appears that each organism has an innate tendency
  to develop in a symmetrical manner, and that this tendency is controlled
  and subordinated by the action of external conditions, and not that this
  symmetry is superinduced only <i>ab externo</i>. In fact, that each
  organism has its own internal and special laws of growth and
  development.</p>

  <p>If, then, it is still necessary to conceive an internal law or
  "substantial form," moulding each organic being,<a name="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> and directing <!-- Page 187 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span>its development as a
  crystal is built up, only in an indefinitely more complex manner, it is
  congruous to imagine the existence of some internal law accounting at the
  same time for specific divergence as well as for specific identity.</p>

  <p>A principle regulating the successive evolution of different organic
  forms is not one whit more mysterious than is the mysterious power by
  which a particle of structureless sarcode develops successively into an
  egg, a grub, a chrysalis, a butterfly, when all the conditions, cosmical,
  physical, chemical, and vital, are supplied, which are the requisite
  accompaniments to determine such evolution. <!-- Page 188 --><span

  <p>Any inquiry into the origin of the notion of "morality"&mdash;the
  conception of "right"&mdash;may, perhaps, be considered as somewhat
  remote from the question of the Genesis of Species; the more so, since
  Mr. Darwin, at one time, disclaimed any pretension to explain the origin
  of the higher psychical phenomena of man. His disciples, however, were
  never equally reticent, and indeed he himself is now not only about to
  produce a work on man (in which this question must be considered), but he
  has distinctly announced the extension of the application of his theory
  to the very phenomena in question. He says:<a name="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> "In the <!-- Page 189 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>[189]</span>distant future I see
  open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based
  on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental
  power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of
  man and his history." It may not be amiss then to glance slightly at the
  question, so much disputed, concerning the origin of ethical conceptions
  and its bearing on the theory of "Natural Selection."</p>

  <p>The followers of Mr. John Stuart Mill, of Mr. Herbert Spencer, and
  apparently, also, of Mr. Darwin, assert that in spite of the great
  <i>present</i> difference between the ideas "useful" and "right," yet
  that they are, nevertheless, one in <i>origin</i>, and that that origin
  consisted ultimately of pleasurable and painful sensations.</p>

  <p>They say that "Natural Selection" has evolved moral conceptions from
  perceptions of what was useful, <i>i.e.</i> pleasurable, by having
  through long ages preserved a predominating number of those individuals
  who have had a natural and spontaneous liking for practices and habits of
  mind useful to the race, and that the same power has destroyed a
  predominating number of those individuals who possessed a marked tendency
  to contrary practices. The descendants of individuals so preserved have,
  they say, come to inherit such a liking and such useful habits of mind,
  and that at last (finding this inherited tendency thus existing in
  themselves, distinct from their tendency to conscious self-gratification)
  they have become apt to regard it as fundamentally distinct,
  <i>innate</i>, and independent of all experience. In fact, according to
  this school, the idea of "right" is only the result of the gradual
  accretion of useful predilections which, from time to time, arose in a
  series of ancestors naturally selected. In this way, "morality" is, as it
  were, the congealed past experience of the race, and "virtue" becomes no
  more than a sort of "retrieving," which the thus improved human animal
  practises by a perfected and inherited habit, regardless of
  self-gratification, just as the brute animal has acquired the habit of
  seeking <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>[190]</span>prey and bringing it to his master,
  instead of devouring it himself.</p>

  <p>Though Mr. Darwin has not as yet expressly advocated this view, yet
  some remarks made by him appear to show his disposition to sympathise
  with it. Thus, in his work on "Animals and Plants under Domestication,"<a
  name="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> he asserts that "the
  savages of Australia and South America hold the crime of incest in
  abhorrence;" but he considers that this abhorrence has probably arisen by
  "Natural Selection," the ill effects of close interbreeding causing the
  less numerous and less healthy offspring of incestuous unions to
  disappear by degrees, in favour of the descendants (greater both in
  number and strength) of individuals who naturally, from some cause or
  other, as he suggests, preferred to mate with strangers rather than with
  close blood-relations; this preference being transmitted and becoming
  thus instinctive, or habitual, in remote descendants.</p>

  <p>But on Mr. Darwin's own ground, it maybe objected that this notion
  fails to account for "abhorrence," and "moral reprobation;" for, as no
  stream can rise higher than its source, the original "slight feeling"
  which was <i>useful</i> would have been perpetuated, but would never have
  been augmented beyond the degree requisite to ensure this beneficial
  preference, and therefore would not certainly have become magnified into
  "abhorrence." It will not do to assume that the union of males and
  females, each possessing the required "slight feeling," must give rise to
  offspring with an intensified feeling of the same kind; for, apart from
  reversion, Mr. Darwin has called attention to the unexpected
  modifications which sometimes result from the union of <i>similarly</i>
  constituted parents. Thus, for example, he tells us:<a name="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> "If two top-knotted canaries are
  matched, the young, instead of having very fine top-knots, are generally
  bald." From examples of this kind, it is fair, on Darwinian principles,
  to infer that the <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>[191]</span>union of parents who possessed a similar
  inherited aversion might result in phenomena quite other than the
  augmentation of such aversion, even if the two aversions should be
  altogether similar; while, very probably, they might be so different in
  their nature as to tend to neutralize each other. Besides, the union of
  parents so similarly emotional would be rare indeed amongst savages,
  where marriages would be owing to almost anything rather than to
  congeniality of mind between the spouses. Mr. Wallace tells us,<a
  name="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> that they choose their
  wives for "rude health and physical beauty," and this is just what might
  be naturally supposed. Again, we must bear in mind the necessity there is
  that <i>many individuals</i> should be similarly and simultaneously
  affected with this aversion from consanguineous unions; as we have seen
  in the second chapter, how infallibly variations presented by only a few
  individuals, tend to be eliminated by mere force of numbers. Mr. Darwin
  indeed would throw back this aversion, if possible, to a pre-human
  period; since he speculates as to whether the gorillas or orang-utans, in
  effecting their matrimonial relations, show any tendency to respect the
  prohibited degrees of affinity.<a name="NtA_206"
  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> No tittle of evidence, however, has
  yet been adduced pointing in any such direction, though surely if it were
  of such importance and efficiency as to result (through the aid of
  "Natural Selection" alone) in that "abhorrence" before spoken of, we
  might expect to be able to detect unmistakeable evidence of its incipient
  stages. On the contrary, as regards the ordinary apes (for with regard to
  the highest there is no evidence of the kind) as we see them in
  confinement, it would be difficult to name any animals less restricted,
  by even a generic bar, in the gratification of the sexual instinct. And
  although the conditions under which they have been observed are abnormal,
  yet these are hardly the animals to present us in a state of nature, with
  an extraordinary and exceptional sensitiveness in such matters. <!-- Page
  192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>[192]</span></p>

  <p>To take an altogether different case. Care of, and tenderness towards,
  the aged and infirm are actions on all hands admitted to be "right;" but
  it is difficult to see how such actions could ever have been so useful to
  a community as to have been seized on and developed by the exclusive
  action of the law of the "survival of the fittest." On the contrary, it
  seems probable that on strict utilitarian principles the rigid political
  economy of Tierra del Fuego would have been eminently favoured and
  diffused by the impartial action of "Natural Selection" alone. By the
  rigid political economy referred to, is meant that destruction and
  utilization of "useless mouths" which Mr. Darwin himself describes in his
  highly interesting "Journal of Researches."<a name="NtA_207"
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> He says: "It is certainly true, that
  when pressed in winter by hunger, they kill and devour their old women
  before they kill their dogs. The boy being asked why they did this,
  answered, 'Doggies catch otters, old women no.' They often run away into
  the mountains, but they are pursued by the men and brought back to the
  slaughter-house at their own firesides." Mr. Edward Bartlett, who has
  recently returned from the Amazons, reports that at one Indian village
  where the cholera made its appearance, the whole population immediately
  dispersed into the woods, leaving the sick to perish uncared for and
  alone. Now, had the Indians remained, undoubtedly far more would have
  died; as doubtless, in Tierra del Fuego, the destruction of the
  comparatively useless old women has often been the means of preserving
  the healthy and reproductive young. Such acts surely must be greatly
  favoured by the stern and unrelenting action of exclusive "Natural
  Selection."</p>

  <p>In the same way that admiration which all feel for acts of self-denial
  done for the good of others, and tending even towards the destruction of
  the actor, could hardly be accounted for on Darwinian principles alone;
  for self-immolators must but rarely leave direct descendants, while the
  community they benefit must <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>[193]</span>by their destruction tend, so far, to
  morally deteriorate. But devotion to others of the same community is by
  no means <i>all</i> that has to be accounted for. Devotion to the whole
  human race, and devotion to God&mdash;in the form of
  asceticism&mdash;have been and are very generally recognized as "good;"
  and the Author contends that it is simply impossible to conceive that
  such ideas and sanctions should have been developed by "Natural
  Selection" alone, from only that degree of unselfishness necessary for
  the preservation of brutally barbarous communities in the struggle for
  life. That degree of unselfishness once attained, further improvement
  would be checked by the mutual opposition of diverging moral tendencies
  and spontaneous variations in all directions. Added to which, we have the
  principle of reversion and atavism, tending powerfully to restore and
  reproduce that more degraded anterior condition whence the later and
  better state painfully emerged.</p>

  <p>Very few, however, dispute the complete distinctness, here and now, of
  the ideas of "duty" and "interest" whatever may have been the origin of
  those ideas. No one pretends that ingratitude may, in any past abyss of
  time, have been a virtue, or that it may be such now in Arcturus or the
  Pleiades. Indeed, a certain eminent writer of the utilitarian school of
  ethics has amusingly and very instructively shown how radically distinct
  even in his own mind are the two ideas which he nevertheless endeavours
  to identify. Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his examination of "Sir William
  Hamilton's Philosophy," says,<a name="NtA_208"
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> if "I am informed that the world is
  ruled by a being whose attributes are infinite, but what they are we
  cannot learn, nor what the principles of his government, except that 'the
  highest human morality which we are capable of conceiving' does not
  sanction them; convince me of it, and I will bear my fate as I may. But
  when I am told that I must believe this, and at the same time call this
  <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>[194]</span>being by the names which express and
  affirm the highest human morality, I say in plain terms that I will not.
  Whatever power such a being may have over me, there is one thing which he
  shall not do: he shall not compel me to worship him. I will call no being
  good, who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my
  fellow-creatures; and if such a being can sentence me to hell for not so
  calling him, to hell I will go."</p>

  <p>This is unquestionably an admirable sentiment on the part of Mr. Mill
  (with which every absolute moralist will agree), but it contains a
  complete refutation of his own position, and is a capital instance<a
  name="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> of the vigorous life
  of moral intuition in one who professes to have eliminated any
  fundamental distinction between the "right" and the "expedient." For if
  an action is morally good, and to be done, merely in proportion to the
  amount of pleasure it secures, and morally bad and to be avoided as
  tending to misery, and if it could be <i>proved</i> that by calling God
  good&mdash;whether He is so or not, in our sense of the term,&mdash;we
  could secure a maximum of pleasure, and by refusing to do so we should
  incur endless torment, clearly, on utilitarian principles, the flattery
  would be good.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mill, of course, must also mean that, in the matter in question,
  all men would do well to act with him. Therefore, he must mean that it
  would be well for all to accept (on the hypothesis above given) infinite
  and final misery for all as the result of the pursuit of happiness as the
  only end.</p>

  <p>It must be recollected that in consenting to worship this unholy God,
  Mr. Mill is not asked to do harm to his neighbour, so that his refusal
  reposes simply on his perception of the immorality of the requisition. It
  is also noteworthy that an omnipotent Deity is supposed incapable of
  altering Mr. Mill's mind and moral perceptions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mill's decision is right, but it is difficult indeed to see <!--
  Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>[195]</span>how,
  without the recognition of an "absolute morality," he can justify so
  utter and final an abandonment of all utility in favour of a clear and
  distinct moral perception.</p>

  <p>These two ideas, the "right" and the "useful," being so distinct here
  and now, a greater difficulty meets us with regard to their origin from
  some common source, than met us before when considering the first
  beginnings of certain bodily structures. For the distinction between the
  "right" and the "useful" is so fundamental and essential that not only
  does the idea of benefit not enter into the idea of duty, but we see that
  the very fact of an act <i>not</i> being beneficial to us makes it the
  more praiseworthy, while gain tends to diminish the merit of an action.
  Yet this idea, "right," thus excluding, as it does, all reference to
  utility or pleasure, has nevertheless to be constructed and evolved from
  utility and pleasure, and ultimately from pleasurable sensations, if we
  are to accept pure Darwinianism: if we are to accept, that is, the
  evolution of man's psychical nature and highest powers, by the exclusive
  action of "Natural Selection," from such faculties as are possessed by
  brutes; in other words, if we are to believe that the conceptions of the
  highest human morality arose through minute and fortuitous variations of
  brutal desires and appetites in all conceivable directions.</p>

  <p>It is here contended, on the other hand, that no conservation of any
  such variations could ever have given rise to the faintest beginning of
  any such moral perceptions; that by "Natural Selection" alone the maxim
  <i>fiat justitia, ruat c&oelig;lum</i> could never have been excogitated,
  still less have found a widespread acceptance; that it is impotent to
  suggest even an approach towards an explanation of the <i>first
  beginning</i> of the idea of "right." It need hardly be remarked that
  acts may be distinguished not only as pleasurable, useful, or beautiful,
  but also as good in two different senses: (1) <i>materially</i> moral
  acts, and (2) acts which are <i>formally</i> moral. The first are acts
  good in themselves, <i>as acts</i>, apart from any intention of the agent
  which may or may not <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>[196]</span>have been directed towards "right." The
  second are acts which are good not only in themselves, as acts, but also
  in the deliberate <i>intention</i> of the agent who recognizes his
  actions as being "right." Thus acts may be <i>materially</i> moral or
  immoral, in a very high degree, without being in the least
  <i>formally</i> so. For example, a person may tend and minister to a sick
  man with scrupulous care and exactness, having in view all the time
  nothing but the future reception of a good legacy. Another may, in the
  dark, shoot his own father, taking him to be an assassin, and so commit
  what is <i>materially</i> an act of parricide, though <i>formally</i> it
  is only an act of self-defence of more or less culpable rashness. A woman
  may innocently, because ignorantly, marry a married man, and so commit a
  <i>material</i> act of adultery. She may discover the facts, and persist,
  and so make her act <i>formal</i> also.</p>

  <p>Actions of brutes, such as those of the bee, the ant, or the beaver,
  however materially good as regards their relation to the community to
  which such animals belong, are absolutely destitute of the most incipient
  degree of real, <i>i.e.</i> formal "goodness," because unaccompanied by
  mental acts of conscious will directed towards the fulfilment of duty.
  Apology is due for thus stating so elementary a distinction, but the
  statement is not superfluous, for confusion of thought, resulting from
  confounding together these very distinct things, is unfortunately far
  from uncommon.</p>

  <p>Thus some Darwinians assert that the germs of morality exist in
  brutes, and we have seen that Mr. Darwin himself speculates on the
  subject as regards the highest apes. It may safely be affirmed, however,
  that there is no trace in brutes of any actions simulating morality which
  are not explicable by the fear of punishment, by the hope of pleasure, or
  by personal affection. No sign of moral reprobation is given by any
  brute, and yet had such existed in germ through Darwinian abysses of past
  time, some evidence of its existence must surely have been rendered
  perceptible through "survival of the fittest" in other forms besides <!--
  Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>man,
  if that "survival" has alone and exclusively produced it in him.</p>

  <p>Abundant examples may, indeed, be brought forward of useful acts which
  simulate morality, such as parental care of the young, &amp;c. But did
  the most undeviating habits guide all brutes in such matters, were even
  aged and infirm members of a community of insects or birds carefully
  tended by young which benefited by their experience, such acts would not
  indicate even the faintest rudiment of real, <i>i.e.</i> formal,
  morality. "Natural Selection" would, of course, often lead to the
  prevalence of acts beneficial to a community, and to acts
  <i>materially</i> good; but unless they can be shown to be
  <i>formally</i> so, they are not in the least to the point, they do not
  offer any explanation of the origin of an altogether new and
  fundamentally different motive and conception.</p>

  <p>It is interesting, on the other hand, to note Mr. Darwin's statement
  as to the existence of a distinct moral feeling, even in, perhaps, the
  very lowest and most degraded of all the human races known to us. Thus in
  the same "Journal of Researches"<a name="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> before quoted, bearing witness to the
  existence of moral reprobation on the part of the Fuegians, he says: "The
  nearest approach to religious feeling which I heard of was shown by York
  Minster (a Fuegian so named), who, when Mr. Bynoe shot some very young
  ducklings as specimens, declared in the most solemn manner, 'Oh, Mr.
  Bynoe, much rain, snow, blow much.' This was evidently a retributive
  punishment for wasting human food."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace gives the most interesting testimony, in his "Malay
  Archipelago," to the existence of a very distinct, and in some instances
  highly developed moral sense in the natives with whom he came in contact.
  In one case,<a name="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> a
  Papuan who had been paid in advance for bird-skins and who had not been
  able <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>to fulfil his contract before Mr. Wallace
  was on the point of starting, "came running down after us holding up a
  bird, and saying with great satisfaction, 'Now I owe you nothing!'" And
  this though he could have withheld payment with complete impunity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace's observations and opinions on this head seem hardly to
  meet with due appreciation in Sir John Lubbock's recent work on Primitive
  Man.<a name="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> But considering
  the acute powers of observation and the industry of Mr. Wallace, and
  especially considering the years he passed in familiar and uninterrupted
  intercourse with natives, his opinion and testimony should surely carry
  with it great weight. He has informed the Author that he found a strongly
  marked and widely diffused modesty, in sexual matters, amongst all the
  tribes with which he came in contact. In the same way Mr. Bonwick, in his
  work on the Tasmanians, testifies to the modesty exhibited by the naked
  females of that race, who by the decorum of their postures gave evidence
  of the possession in germ of what under circumstances would become the
  highest chastity and refinement.</p>

  <p>Hasty and incomplete observations and inductions are prejudicial
  enough to physical science, but when their effect is to degrade
  untruthfully our common humanity, there is an additional motive to regret
  them. A hurried visit to a tribe, whose language, traditions and customs
  are unknown, is sometimes deemed sufficient for "smart" remarks as to
  "ape characters," &amp;c., which are as untrue as irrelevant. It should
  not be forgotten how extremely difficult it is to enter into the ideas
  and feelings of an alien race. If in the nineteenth century a French
  theatrical audience can witness with acquiescent approval, as a type of
  English manners and ideas, the representation of a marquis who sells his
  wife at Smithfield, &amp;c. &amp;c., it is surely no <!-- Page 199
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>[199]</span>wonder if the
  ideas of a tribe of newly visited savages should be more or less
  misunderstood. To enter into such ideas requires long and familiar
  intimacy, like that experienced by the explorer of the Malay Archipelago.
  From him, and others, we have abundant evidence that moral ideas exist,
  at least in germ, in savage races of men, while they sometimes attain
  even a highly developed state. No amount of evidence as to acts of moral
  depravity is to the point, as the object here aimed at is to establish
  that moral intuitions <i>exist</i> in savages, not that their actions are
  good.</p>

  <p>Objections, however, are sometimes drawn from the different notions as
  to the moral value of certain acts, entertained by men of various
  countries or of different epochs; also from the difficulty of knowing
  what particular actions in certain cases are the right ones, and from the
  effects which prejudice, interest, passion, habit, or even, indirectly,
  physical conditions, may have upon our moral perceptions. Thus Sir John
  Lubbock speaks<a name="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> of
  certain Feejeeans, who, according to the testimony of Mr. Hunt,<a
  name="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> have the custom of
  piously choking their parents under certain circumstances, in order to
  insure their happiness in a future life. Should any one take such facts
  as telling <i>against</i> the belief in an absolute morality, he would
  show a complete misapprehension of the point in dispute; for such facts
  tell in <i>favour</i> of it.</p>

  <p>Were it asserted that man possesses a distinct innate power and
  faculty by which he is made intuitively aware what acts considered in and
  by themselves are right and what wrong,&mdash;an infallible and universal
  internal code,&mdash;the illustration would be to the point. But all that
  need be contended for is that the intellect perceives not only truth, but
  also a quality of "higher" which ought to be followed, and of "lower"
  which ought to be avoided; when two lines of conduct are presented to the
  will for choice, the intellect so acting being the conscience.</p>

<p><!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[200]</span></p>

  <p>This has been well put by Mr. James Martineau in his excellent essay
  on Whewell's Morality. He says,<a name="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> "If moral good were a quality
  resident in each action, as whiteness in snow, or sweetness in fruits;
  and if the moral faculty was our appointed instrument for detecting its
  presence; many consequences would ensue which are at variance with fact.
  The wide range of differences observable in the ethical judgments of men
  would not exist; and even if they did, could no more be reduced and
  modified by discussion than constitutional differences of hearing or of
  vision. And, as the quality of moral good either must or must not exist
  in every important operation of the will, we should discern its presence
  or absence separately in each; and even though we never had the
  conception of more than one insulated action, we should be able to
  pronounce upon its character. This, however, we have plainly no power to
  do. Every moral judgment is relative, and involves a comparison of two
  terms. When we praise what <i>has been</i> done, it is with the
  coexistent conception of something <i>else</i> that <i>might have
  been</i> done; and when we resolve on a course as right, it is to the
  exclusion of some other that is wrong. This fact, that every ethical
  decision is in truth a <i>preference</i>, an election of one act as
  higher than another, appears of fundamental importance in the analysis of
  the moral sentiments."</p>

  <p>From this point of view it is plain how trifling are arguments drawn
  from the acts of a savage, since an action highly immoral in us might be
  one exceedingly virtuous in him&mdash;being the highest presented to his
  choice in his degraded intellectual condition and peculiar
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>It need only be contended, then, that there <i>is</i> a perception of
  "right" incapable of further analysis; not that there is any infallible
  internal guide as to all the complex actions which <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span>present themselves for
  choice. The <i>principle</i> is given in our nature, the
  <i>application</i> of the principle is the result of a thousand
  educational influences.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder, then, that, in complex "cases of conscience," it is
  sometimes a matter of exceeding difficulty to determine which of two
  courses of action is the less objectionable. This no more invalidates the
  truth of moral principles than does the difficulty of a mathematical
  problem cast doubt on mathematical principles. Habit, education, and
  intellectual gifts facilitate the correct application of both.</p>

  <p>Again, if our moral insight is intensified or blunted by our habitual
  wishes or, indirectly, by our physical condition, the same may be said of
  our perception of the true relations of physical facts one to another. An
  eager wish for marriage has led many a man to exaggerate the powers of a
  limited income, and a fit of dyspepsia has given an unreasonably gloomy
  aspect to more than one balance-sheet.</p>

  <p>Considering that moral intuitions have to do with <i>insensible</i>
  matters, they cannot be expected to be more clear than the perception of
  physical facts. And if the latter perceptions may be influenced by
  volition, desire, or health, our moral views may also be expected to be
  so influenced, and this in a higher degree because they so often run
  counter to our desires. A bottle or two of wine may make a sensible
  object appear double; what wonder, then, if our moral perceptions are
  sometimes warped and distorted by such powerful agencies as an evil
  education or an habitual absence of self-restraint. In neither case does
  occasional distortion invalidate the accuracy of normal and habitual
  perception.</p>

  <p>The distinctness here and now of the ideas of "right" and "useful" is
  however, as before said, fully conceded by Mr. Herbert Spencer, although
  he contends that these conceptions are one in root and origin.</p>

  <p>His utilitarian Genesis of Morals, however, has been recently <!--
  Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>[202]</span>combated by Mr. Richard Holt Hutton in a
  paper which appeared in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>.<a name="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This writer aptly objects an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, applying to
  morals the same argument that has been applied in this work to our sense
  of musical harmony, and by Mr. Wallace to the vocal organs of man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Herbert Spencer's notions on the subject are thus expressed by
  himself: "To make my position fully understood, it seems needful to add
  that, corresponding to the fundamental propositions of a developed moral
  science, there have been, and still are developing in the race certain
  fundamental moral intuitions; and that, though these moral intuitions are
  the result of accumulated experiences of utility gradually organized and
  inherited, they have come to be quite independent of conscious
  experience. Just in the same way that I believe the intuition of space
  possessed by any living individual to have arisen from organized and
  consolidated experiences of all antecedent individuals, who bequeathed to
  him their slowly developed nervous organizations; just as I believe that
  this intuition, requiring only to be made definite and complete by
  personal experiences, has practically become a form of thought quite
  independent of experience;&mdash;so do I believe that the experiences of
  utility, organized and consolidated through all past generations of the
  human race, have been producing corresponding nervous modifications
  which, by continued transmissions and accumulation, have become in us
  certain faculties of moral intuition, active emotions responding to right
  and wrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in the individual
  experiences of utility. I also hold that, just as the space intuition
  responds to the exact demonstrations of geometry, and has its rough
  conclusions interpreted and verified by them, so will moral intuitions
  respond to the demonstrations of moral science, and will have their rough
  conclusions interpreted and verified by them."</p>

<p><!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span></p>

  <p>Against this view of Mr. Herbert Spencer, Mr. Hutton objects&mdash;"1.
  That even as regards Mr. Spencer's illustration from geometrical
  intuitions, his process would be totally inadequate, since you could not
  deduce the necessary space intuition of which he speaks from any possible
  accumulations of familiarity with space relations.... We cannot
  <i>inherit</i> more than our fathers <i>had</i>: no amount of experience
  of facts, however universal, can give rise to that particular
  characteristic of intuitions and <i>a priori</i> ideas, which compels us
  to deny the possibility that in any other world, however otherwise
  different, our experience (as to space relations) could be otherwise.</p>

  <p>"2. That the case of moral intuitions is very much stronger.</p>

  <p>"3. That if Mr. Spencer's theory accounts for anything, it accounts
  not for the deepening of a sense of utility and inutility into right and
  wrong, but for the drying up of the sense of utility and inutility into
  mere inherent tendencies, which would exercise over us not <i>more</i>
  authority but <i>less</i>, than a rational sense of utilitarian
  issues.</p>

  <p>"4. That Mr. Spencer's theory could not account for the intuitional
  sacredness now attached to <i>individual</i> moral rules and principles,
  without accounting <i>a fortiori</i> for the general claim of the
  greatest happiness principle over us as the final moral
  intuition&mdash;-which is conspicuously contrary to the fact, as not even
  the utilitarians themselves plead any instinctive or intuitive sanction
  for their great principle.</p>

  <p>"5. That there is no trace of positive evidence of any single instance
  of the transformation of a utilitarian rule of right into an intuition,
  since we find no utilitarian principle of the most ancient times which is
  now an accepted moral intuition, nor any moral intuition, however sacred,
  which has not been promulgated thousands of years ago, and which has not
  constantly had to stop the tide of utilitarian <i>objections</i> to its
  authority&mdash;and this age after age, in our own day quite as much as
  in days gone by.... Surely, if anything is remarkable in <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>the history of
  morality, it is the <i>anticipatory</i> character, if I may use the
  expression, of moral principles&mdash;the intensity and absoluteness with
  which they are laid down ages before the world has approximated to the
  ideal thus asserted."</p>

  <p>Sir John Lubbock, in his work on Primitive Man before referred to,
  abandons Mr. Spencer's explanation of the genesis of morals while
  referring to Mr. Hutton's criticisms on the subject. Sir John proposes to
  substitute "deference to authority" instead of "sense of interest" as the
  origin of our conception of "duty," saying that what has been found to be
  beneficial has been traditionally inculcated on the young, and thus has
  become to be dissociated from "interest" in the mind, though the
  inculcation itself originally sprung from that source. This, however,
  when analysed, turns out to be a distinction without a difference. It is
  nothing but utilitarianism, pure and simple, after all. For it can never
  be intended that authority is obeyed because of an intuition that it
  <i>should be deferred to</i>, for that would be to admit the very
  principle of absolute morality which Sir John combats. It must be meant,
  then, that authority is obeyed through fear of the consequences of
  disobedience, or through pleasure felt in obeying the authority which
  commands. In the latter case we have "pleasure" as the end and no
  rudiment of the conception "duty." In the former we have fear of
  punishment, which appeals directly to the sense of "utility to the
  individual," and no amount of such a sense will produce the least germ of
  "ought" which is a conception different <i>in kind</i>, and in which the
  notion of "punishment" has no place. Thus, Sir John Lubbock's explanation
  only concerns a <i>mode</i> in which the sense of "duty" may be
  stimulated or appealed to, and makes no approximation to an explanation
  of its origin.</p>

  <p>Could the views of Mr. Herbert Spencer, of Mr. Mill, or of Mr. Darwin
  on this subject be maintained, or should they come to be generally
  accepted, the consequences would be disastrous indeed! Were it really the
  case that virtue was a <i>mere kind of <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>[205]</span>"retrieving,"</i> then
  certainly we should have to view with apprehension the spread of
  intellectual cultivation, which would lead the human "retrievers" to
  regard from a new point of view their fetching and carrying. We should be
  logically compelled to acquiesce in the vociferations of some continental
  utilitarians, who would banish altogether the senseless words "duty" and
  "merit;" and then, one important influence which has aided human progress
  being withdrawn, we should be reduced to hope that in this case the maxim
  <i>cessante causa cessat ipse effectus</i> might through some
  incalculable accident fail to apply.</p>

  <p>It is true that Mr. Spencer tries to erect a safeguard against such
  moral disruption, by asserting that for every immoral act, word, or
  thought, each man during this life receives minute and exact retribution,
  and that thus a regard for individual self-interest will effectually
  prevent any moral catastrophe. But by what means will he enforce the
  acceptance of a dogma which is not only incapable of proof, but is
  opposed to the commonly received opinion of mankind in all ages? Ancient
  literature, sacred and profane, teems with protests against the
  successful evil-doer, and certainly, as Mr. Hutton observes,<a
  name="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> "Honesty must have
  been associated by our ancestors with many unhappy as well as many happy
  consequences, and we know that in ancient Greece dishonesty was openly
  and actually associated with happy consequences.... When the concentrated
  experience of previous generations was held, <i>not</i> indeed to
  justify, but to excuse by utilitarian considerations, craft,
  dissimulation, sensuality, selfishness."</p>

  <p>This dogma is opposed to the moral consciousness of many as to the
  events of their own lives; and the Author, for one, believes that it is
  absolutely contrary to fact.</p>

  <p>History affords multitudes of instances, but an example may be
  selected from one of the most critical periods of modern <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[206]</span>times. Let it
  be granted that Lewis the Sixteenth of France and his queen had all the
  defects attributed to them by the most hostile of serious historians; let
  all the excuses possible be made for his predecessor, Lewis the
  Fifteenth, and also for Madame de Pompadour, can it be pretended that
  there are grounds for affirming that the vices of the two former so far
  exceeded those of the latter, that their respective fates were plainly
  and evidently just? that while the two former died in their beds, after a
  life of the most extreme luxury, the others merited to stand forth
  through coming time as examples of the most appalling and calamitous
  tragedy?</p>

  <p>This theme, however, is too foreign to the immediate matter in hand to
  be further pursued, tempting as it is. But a passing protest against a
  superstitious and deluding dogma may stand,&mdash;a dogma which may, like
  any other dogma, be vehemently asserted and maintained, but which is
  remarkable for being destitute, at one and the same time, of both
  authoritative sanction and the support of reason and observation.</p>

  <p>To return to the bearing of moral conceptions on "Natural Selection,"
  it seems that, from the reasons given in this chapter, we may safely
  affirm&mdash;1. That "Natural Selection" could not have produced, from
  the sensations of pleasure and pain experienced by brutes, a higher
  degree of morality than was useful; therefore it could have produced any
  amount of "beneficial habits," but not abhorrence of certain acts as
  impure and sinful.</p>

  <p>2. That it could not have developed that high esteem for acts of care
  and tenderness to the aged and infirm which actually exists, but would
  rather have perpetuated certain low social conditions which obtain in
  some savage localities.</p>

  <p>3. That it could not have evolved from ape sensations the noble virtue
  of a Marcus Aurelius, or the loving but manly devotion of a St.
  Lewis.</p>

  <p>4. That, alone, it could not have given rise to the maxim <i>fiat

  <p>5. That the interval between material and formal morality is one
  altogether beyond its power to traverse.</p>

  <p>Also, that the anticipatory character of moral principles is a fatal
  bar to that explanation of their origin which is offered to us by Mr.
  Herbert Spencer. And, finally, that the solution of that origin proposed
  recently by Sir John Lubbock is a mere version of simple utilitarianism,
  appealing to the pleasure or safety of the individual, and therefore
  utterly incapable of solving the riddle it attacks.</p>

  <p>Such appearing to be the case as to the power of "Natural Selection,"
  we, nevertheless, find moral conceptions&mdash;<i>formally</i> moral
  ideas&mdash;not only spread over the civilized world, but manifesting
  themselves unmistakeably (in however rudimentary a condition, and however
  misapplied) amongst the lowest and most degraded of savages. If from
  amongst these, individuals can be brought forward who seem to be
  destitute of any moral conception, similar cases also may easily be found
  in highly civilized communities. Such cases tell no more against moral
  intuitions than do cases of colour-blindness or idiotism tell against
  sight and reason. We have thus a most important and conspicuous fact, the
  existence of which is fatal to the theory of "Natural Selection," as put
  forward of late by Mr. Darwin and his most ardent followers. It must be
  remarked, however, that whatever force this fact may have against a
  belief in the origination of man from brutes by minute, fortuitous
  variations, it has no force whatever against the conception of the
  orderly evolution and successive manifestation of specific forms by
  ordinary natural law&mdash;even if we include amongst such the upright
  frame, the ready hand and massive brain of man himself. <!-- Page 208

</blockquote>

  <p>In addition to the theory of "Natural Selection," by which it has been
  attempted to account for the origin of species, Mr. Darwin has also put
  forward what he modestly terms "a provisional hypothesis" (that of
  <i>Pangenesis</i>), by which to account for the origin of each and every
  individual form.</p>

  <p>Now, though the hypothesis of Pangenesis is no necessary part of
  "Natural Selection," still any treatise on specific origination would be
  incomplete if it did not take into consideration this last speculation of
  Mr. Darwin. The hypothesis in question may be stated as follows: That
  each living organism is ultimately made up of an almost infinite number
  of minute particles, or organic atoms, termed "gemmules," each of which
  has the power of reproducing its kind. Moreover, that these particles
  circulate freely about the organism which is made up of them, and are
  derived from all the parts of all the organs of the less <!-- Page 209
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>[209]</span>remote
  ancestors of each such organism during all the states and stages of such
  several ancestors' existence; and therefore of the several states of each
  of such ancestors' organs. That such a complete collection of gemmules is
  aggregated in each ovum and spermatozoon in most animals, and in each
  part capable of reproducing by gemmation (budding) in the lowest animals
  and in plants. Therefore in many of such lower organisms such a congeries
  of ancestral gemmules must exist in every part of their bodies, since in
  them every part is capable of reproducing by gemmation. Mr. Darwin must
  evidently admit this, since he says: "It has often been said by
  naturalists that each cell of a plant has the actual or potential
  capacity of reproducing the whole plant; but it has this power only in
  virtue of containing gemmules <i>derived from every part</i>."<a
  name="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Moreover, these gemmules are supposed to tend to aggregate themselves,
  and to reproduce in certain definite relations to other gemmules. Thus,
  when the foot of an eft is cut off, its reproduction is explained by Mr.
  Darwin as resulting from the aggregation of those floating gemmules which
  come next in order to those of the cut surface, and the successive
  aggregations of the other kinds of gemmules which come after in regular
  order. Also, the most ordinary processes of repair are similarly
  accounted for, and the successive development of similar parts and organs
  in creatures in which such complex evolutions occur is explained in the
  same way, by the independent action of separate gemmules.</p>

  <p>In order that each living creature may be thus furnished, the number
  of such gemmules in each must be inconceivably great. Mr. Darwin says:<a
  name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> "In a highly organized
  and complex animal, the gemmules thrown off from each different cell or
  unit throughout the body must be inconceivably numerous and minute. Each
  unit of each part, as it changes during development&mdash;and we <!--
  Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[210]</span>know
  that some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses&mdash;must throw
  off its gemmules. All organic beings, moreover, include many dormant
  gemmules derived from their grandparents and more remote progenitors, but
  not from all their progenitors. These <i>almost infinitely numerous</i>
  and minute gemmules must be included in each bud, ovule, spermatozoon,
  and pollen grain." We have seen also that in certain cases a similar
  multitude of gemmules must be included also in every considerable part of
  the whole body of each organism, but where are we to stop? There must be
  gemmules not only from every organ, but from every component part of such
  organ, from every subdivision of such component part, and from every
  cell, thread, or fibre entering into the composition of such subdivision.
  Moreover, not only from all these, but from each and every successive
  stage of the evolution and development of such successively more and more
  elementary parts. At the first glance this new atomic theory has charms
  from its apparent simplicity, but the attempt thus to follow it out into
  its ultimate limits and extreme consequences seems to indicate that it is
  at once insufficient and cumbrous.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin himself is, of course, fully aware that there must be
  <i>some</i> limit to this aggregation of gemmules. He says:<a
  name="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> "Excessively minute
  and numerous as they are believed to be, an infinite number derived,
  during a long course of modification and descent, from each cell of each
  progenitor, could not be supported and nourished by the organism."</p>

  <p>But apart from these matters, which will be more fully considered
  further on, the hypothesis not only does not appear to account for
  certain phenomena which, in order to be a valid theory, it ought to
  account for; but it seems absolutely to conflict with patent and
  notorious facts.</p>

  <p>How, for example, does it explain the peculiar reproduction <!-- Page
  211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[211]</span>which is
  found to take place in certain marine worms&mdash;certain annelids?</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/185.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/185.png"
      alt="An Annelid dividing." title="An Annelid dividing." /></a>
    AN ANNELID DIVIDING SPONTANEOUSLY.<br /> (A new head having been formed
    towards the hinder end of the body of the parent.)
  </div>
  <p>In such creatures we see that, from time to time, one of the segments
  of the body gradually becomes modified till it assumes the condition of a
  head, and this remarkable phenomenon is repeated again and again, the
  body of the worm thus multiplying serially into new individuals which
  successively detach themselves from the older portion. The development of
  such a mode of reproduction by "Natural Selection" seems not less
  inexplicable than does its continued performance through the aid of <!--
  Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>[212]</span>"pangenesis." For how can gemmules attach
  themselves to others to which they do not normally or generally succeed?
  Scarcely less difficult to understand is the process of the
  stomach-carrying-off mode of metamorphosis before spoken of as existing
  in the Echinoderms. Next, as to certain patent and notorious facts: On
  the hypothesis of pangenesis, no creature can develop an organ unless it
  possesses the component gemmules which serve for its formation. No
  creature can possess such gemmules unless it inherits them from its
  parents, grandparents, or its less remote ancestors. Now, the Jews are
  remarkably scrupulous as to marriage, and rarely contract such a union
  with individuals not of their own race. This practice has gone on for
  thousands of years, and similarly also for thousands of years the rite of
  circumcision has been unfailingly and carefully performed. If then the
  hypothesis of pangenesis is well founded, that rite ought to be now
  absolutely or nearly superfluous from the necessarily continuous absence
  of certain gemmules through so many centuries and so many generations.
  Yet it is not at all so, and this fact seems to amount almost to an
  experimental demonstration that the hypothesis of pangenesis is an
  insufficient explanation of individual evolution.</p>

  <p>Two exceedingly good criticisms of Mr. Darwin's hypothesis have
  appeared. One of these is by Mr. G. H. Lewes,<a name="NtA_221"
  href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> the other by Professor Delpino of
  Florence.<a name="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> The latter
  gentleman gives a report of an observation made by him upon a certain
  plant, which observation adds force to what has just been said about the
  Jewish race. He says:<a name="NtA_223"
  href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> "If we examine and compare the
  numerous species of the genus <i>Salvia</i>, commencing with <i>Salvia
  officinalis</i>, which may pass as the main state of the genus, and <!--
  Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>[213]</span>concluding with <i>Salvia
  verticillata</i>, which may be taken as the most highly developed form,
  and as the most distant from the type, we observe a singular phenomenon.
  The lower cell of each of the two fertile anthers, which is much reduced
  and different from the superior even in <i>Salvia officinalis</i>, is
  transmuted in other <i>salviæ</i> into an organ (nectarotheca) having a
  very different form and function, and finally disappears entirely in
  <i>Salvia verticillata</i>.</p>

  <p>"Now, on one occasion, in a flower belonging to an individual of
  <i>Salvia verticillata</i>, and only on the left stamen, I observed a
  perfectly developed and pollinigerous lower cell, perfectly homologous
  with that which is normally developed in <i>Salvia officinalis</i>. This
  case of atavism is truly singular. According to the theory of Pangenesis,
  it is necessary to assume that all the gemmules of this anomalous
  formation, and therefore the mother-gemmule of the cell, and the
  daughter-gemmules of the special epidermic tissue, and of the very
  singular subjacent tissue of the endothecium, have been perpetuated, and
  transmitted from parent to offspring in a dormant state, and through a
  number of generations, such as startles the imagination, and leads it to
  refuse its consent to the theory of Pangenesis, however seductive it may
  be." This seems a strong confirmation of what has been here advanced.</p>

  <p>The main objection raised against Mr. Darwin's hypothesis is that it
  (Pangenesis) requires so many subordinate hypotheses for its support, and
  that some of these are not tenable.</p>

  <p>Professor Delpino considers<a name="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> that as many as eight of these
  subordinate hypotheses are required, namely, that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1. The emission of the gemmules takes place, or may take place in all
  states of the cell.</p>

  <p>"2. The quantity of gemmules emitted from every cell is very
  great.</p>

  <p>"3. The minuteness of the gemmules is extreme.</p>

<p><!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[214]</span></p>

  <p>"4. The gemmules possess two sorts of affinity, one of which might be
  called <i>propagative</i>, and the other <i>germinative</i> affinity.</p>

  <p>"5. By means of the propagative affinity all the gemmules emitted by
  all the cells of the individual flow together and become condensed in the
  cells which compose the sexual organs, whether male or female (embryonal
  vesicle, cells of the embryo, pollen grains, fovilla, antherozoids,
  spermatozoids), and likewise flow together and become condensed in the
  cells which constitute the organs of a sexual or agamic reproduction
  (buds, spores, bulbilli, portions of the body separated by scission,
  &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>"6. By means of the germinative affinity, every gemmule (except in
  cases of anomalies or monstrosities) can be developed only in cells
  homologous with the mother-cells of the cell from which they originated.
  In other words, the gemmules from any cell can only be developed in
  unison with the cell preceding it in due order of succession, and whilst
  in a nascent state.</p>

  <p>"7. Of each kind of gernmule a great number perishes; a great number
  remains in a dormant state through many generations in the bodies of
  descendants; the remainder germinate and reproduce the mother-cell.</p>

  <p>"8. Every gemmule may multiply itself by a process of scission into
  any number of equivalent gemmules."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin has published a short notice in reply to Professor Delpino,
  in <i>Scientific Opinion</i> of October 20, 1869, p. 426. In this reply
  he admits the justice of Professor Delpino's attack, but objects to the
  alleged necessity of the first subordinate hypothesis, namely, that the
  emission of gemmules takes place in all states of the cell. But if this
  is not the case, then a great part of the utility and distinction of
  pangenesis is destroyed, or as Mr. Lewes justly says,<a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> "If gemmules produce whole cells, we
  have the very power which was pronounced mysterious in larger
  organisms."</p>

<p><!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[215]</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin also does not see the force of the objection to the power
  of self-division which must be asserted of the gemmules themselves if
  Pangenesis be true. The objection, however, appears to many to be
  formidable. To admit the power of spontaneous division and multiplication
  in such rudimentary structures, seems a complete contradiction. The
  gemmules, by the hypothesis of Pangenesis, are the ultimate organized
  components of the body, the absolute organic atoms of which each body is
  composed; how then <i>can</i> they be divisible? Any part of a gemmule
  would be an impossible (because a <i>less</i> than possible) quantity. If
  it is divisible into still smaller organic wholes, as a germ-cell is, it
  must be made up as the germ-cell is, of subordinate component atoms,
  which are then the <i>true</i> gemmules. This process may be repeated
  <i>ad infinitum</i>, unless we get to true organic atoms, the true
  gemmules, whatever they may be, and they necessarily will be incapable of
  any process of spontaneous fission. It is remarkable that Mr. Darwin
  brings forward in support of gemmule fission, the observation that
  "Thuret has seen the zoospore of an alga divide itself, and both halves
  germinate." Yet on the hypothesis of Pangenesis, the zoospore of an alga
  must contain gemmules from all the cells of the parent algæ, and from all
  the parts of all their less remote ancestors in all their stages of
  existence. What wonder then that such an excessively complex body should
  divide and multiply; and what parity is there between such a body and a
  gemmule? A steam-engine and a steel-filing might equally well be compared
  together.</p>

  <p>Professor Delpino makes a further objection which, however, will only
  be of weight in the eyes of Vitalists. He says,<a name="NtA_226"
  href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> Pangenesis is not to be received
  because "it leads directly to the negation of a specific vital principle,
  co-ordinating and regulating all the movements, acts, and functions of
  the individuals in which it is incarnated. For Pangenesis of the
  individual is a <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>[216]</span>term without meaning. If, in contemplating
  an animal of high organization, we regard it purely as an aggregation of
  developed gemmules, although these gemmules have been evolved
  successively one after the other, and one within the other,
  notwithstanding they elude the conception of the <i>real and true
  individual</i>, these problematical and invisible gemmules must be
  regarded as so many individuals. Now, that real, true, living individuals
  exist in nature, is a truth which is persistently attested to us by our
  consciousness. But how, then, can we explain that a great quantity of
  dissimilar elements, like the atoms of matter, can unite to form those
  perfect unities which we call individuals, if we do not suppose the
  existence of a specific principle, proper to the individual but foreign
  to the component atoms, which aggregates these said atoms, groups them
  into molecules, and then moulds the molecules into cells, the cells into
  tissues, the tissues into organs, and the organs into apparatus?"</p>

  <p>"But, it may be urged in opposition by the Pangenesists, your vital
  principle is an unknown and irresolute <i>x</i>. This is true; but, on
  the other hand, let us see whether Pangenesis produces a clearer formula,
  and one free from unknown elements. The existence of the gemmules is a
  first unknown element; the propagative affinity of the gemmules is a
  second; their germinative affinity is a third; their multiplication by
  fission is a fourth&mdash;and what an unknown element!"</p>

  <p>"Thus, in Pangenesis, everything proceeds by force of unknown
  elements, and we may ask whether it is more logical to prefer a system
  which assumes a multitude of unknown elements to a system which assumes
  only a single one?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin appears, by "Natural Selection," to destroy the reality of
  species, and by Pangenesis that of the individual. Mr. Lewes observes<a
  name="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> of the individual that
  "This whole is only a subjective conception which summarizes the parts,
  and that in <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>[217]</span>point of fact it is the parts which are
  reproduced." But the parts are also, from the same point of view, merely
  subjective until we come to the absolute organic atoms. These atoms, on
  the other hand, are utterly invisible, intangible; indeed, in the words
  of Mr. Darwin, inconceivable. Thus, then, it results from the theories in
  question, that the organic world is reduced to utter unreality as regards
  all that can be perceived by the senses or distinctly imagined by the
  mind; while the only reality consists of the invisible, the insensible,
  the inconceivable; in other words, nothing is known that really is, and
  only the nonexistent can be known. A somewhat paradoxical outcome of the
  speculations of those who profess to rely exclusively on the testimony of
  sense. "<i>Les extrêmes se touchent</i>," and extreme sensationalism
  shakes hands with the "das seyn ist das nichts" of Hegel.</p>

  <p>Altogether the hypothesis of Pangenesis seems to be little, if at all,
  superior to anterior hypotheses of a more or less similar nature.</p>

  <p>Apart from the atoms of Democritus, and apart also from the
  speculations of mediæval writers, the molecules of Bonnet and of Buffon
  almost anticipated the hypothesis of Pangenesis. According to the
  last-named author,<a name="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>
  organic particles from every part of the body assemble in the sexual
  secretions, and by their union build up the embryo, each particle taking
  its due place, and occupying in the offspring a similar position to that
  which it occupied in the parents. In 1849 Professor Owen, in his treatise
  on "Parthenogenesis," put forward another conception. According to this,
  the cells resulting from the subdivision of the germ-cell preserve their
  developmental force, unless employed in building up definite organic
  structures. In certain creatures, and in certain parts of other
  creatures, germ-cells unused are stored <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span>up, and by their agency
  lost limbs and other mutilations are repaired. Such unused products of
  the germ-cell are also supposed to become located in the generative
  products.</p>

  <p>According to Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his "Principles of Biology," each
  living organism consists of certain so-called "physiological units." Each
  of these units has an innate power and capacity, by which it tends to
  build up and reproduce the entire organism of which it forms a part,
  unless in the meantime its force is exhausted by its taking part in the
  production of some distinct and definite tissue&mdash;a condition
  somewhat similar to that conceived by Professor Owen.</p>

  <p>Now, at first sight, Mr. Darwin's atomic theory appears to be more
  simple than any of the others. It has been objected that while Mr.
  Spencer's theory requires the assumption of an innate power and tendency
  in each physiological unit, Mr. Darwin's, on the other hand, requires
  nothing of the kind, but explains the evolution of each individual by
  purely mechanical conceptions. In fact, however, it is not so. Each
  gemmule, according to Mr. Darwin, is really the seat of powers, elective
  affinities, and special tendencies as marked and mysterious as those
  possessed by the physiological unit of Mr. Spencer, with the single
  exception that the former has no tendency to build up the whole living,
  complex organism of which it forms a part. Some may think this an
  important distinction, but it can hardly be so, for Mr. Darwin considers
  that his gemmule has the innate power and tendency to build up and
  transform itself into the whole living, complex cell of which it forms a
  part; and the one tendency is, in principle, fully as difficult to
  understand, fully as mysterious, as is the other. The difference is but
  one of degree, not of kind. Moreover, the one mystery in the case of the
  "physiological unit" explains all, while with regard to the gemmule, as
  we have seen, it has to be supplemented by other powers and tendencies,
  each distinct, and each in itself inexplicable and profoundly mysterious.
  <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>[219]</span></p>

  <p>That there should be physiological units possessed of the power
  attributed to them, harmonizes with what has recently been put forward by
  Dr. H. Charlton Bastian; who maintains that under fit conditions the
  simplest organisms develop themselves into relatively large and complex
  ones. This is not supposed by him to be due to any inheritance of
  ancestral gemmules, but to direct growth and transformation of the most
  minute and the simplest organisms, which themselves, by all reason and
  analogy, owe their existence to immediate transformation from the
  inorganic world.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, there are grave difficulties in the way of the reception
  of the hypothesis of Pangenesis, which moreover, if established, would
  leave the evolution of individual organisms, when thoroughly analysed,
  little if at all less mysterious or really explicable than it is at
  present.</p>

  <p>As was said at the beginning of this chapter, "Pangenesis" and
  "Natural Selection" are quite separable and distinct hypotheses. The fall
  of one of these by no means necessarily includes that of the other.
  Nevertheless, Mr. Darwin has associated them closely together, and,
  therefore, the refutation of Pangenesis may render it advisable for those
  who have hitherto accepted "Natural Selection" to reconsider that theory.

</blockquote>

  <p>Having now severally reviewed the principal biological facts which
  bear upon specific manifestation, it remains to sum up the results, and
  to endeavour to ascertain what, if anything, can be said
  <i>positively</i>, as well as negatively, on this deeply interesting
  question.</p>

  <p>In the preceding chapters it has been contended, in the first place,
  that no mere survival of the fittest accidental and minute variations can
  account for the incipient stages of useful structures, such as,
  <i>e.g.</i>, the heads of flat-fishes, the baleen of whales, vertebrate
  limbs, the laryngeal structures of the newborn kangaroo, the pedicellariæ
  of Echinoderms, or for many of the facts of mimicry, and especially those
  last touches of mimetic perfection, where an insect not only mimics a
  leaf, but one worm-eaten and attacked by fungi. <!-- Page 221 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>[221]</span></p>

  <p>Also, that structures like the hood of the cobra and the rattle of the
  rattlesnake seem to require another explanation.</p>

  <p>Again, it has been contended that instances of colour, as in some
  apes; of beauty, as in some shell-fish; and of utility, as in many
  orchids, are examples of conditions which are quite beyond the power of
  Natural Selection to originate and develop.</p>

  <p>Next, the peculiar mode of origin of the eye (by the simultaneous and
  concurrent modification of distinct parts), with the wonderful refinement
  of the human ear and voice, have been insisted on; as also, that the
  importance of all these facts is intensified through the necessity
  (admitted by Mr. Darwin) that many individuals should be similarly and
  simultaneously modified in order that slightly favourable variations may
  hold their own in the struggle for life, against the overwhelming force
  and influence of mere number.</p>

  <p>Again, we have considered, in the third chapter, the great
  improbability that from minute variations in all directions alone and
  unaided, save by the survival of the fittest, closely similar structures
  should independently arise; though, on a non-Darwinian evolutionary
  hypothesis, their development might be expected <i>a priori</i>. We have
  seen, however, that there are many instances of wonderfully close
  similarity which are not due to genetic affinity; the most notable
  instance, perhaps, being that brought forward by Mr. Murphy, namely, the
  appearance of the same eye-structure in the vertebrate and molluscous
  sub-kingdoms. A curious resemblance, though less in degree, has also been
  seen to exist between the auditory organs of fishes and of Cephalopods.
  Remarkable similarities between certain placental and implacental
  mammals, between the bird's-head processes of Polyzoa and the
  pedicellariæ of Echinoderms, between Ichthyosauria and Cetacea, with very
  many other similar coincidences, have also been pointed out.</p>

  <p>Evidence has also been brought forward to show that similarity is
  sometimes directly induced by very obscure conditions, <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[222]</span>at present
  quite inexplicable, <i>e.g.</i> by causes immediately connected with
  geographical distribution; as in the loss of the tail in certain forms of
  Lepidoptera and in simultaneous modifications of colour in others, and in
  the direct modification of young English oysters, when transported to the
  shore of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>Again, it has been asserted that certain groups of organic forms seem
  to have an innate tendency to remarkable developments of some particular
  kind, as beauty and singularity of plumage in the group of birds of
  paradise.</p>

  <p>It has also been contended that there is something to be said in
  favour of sudden, as opposed to exceedingly minute and gradual,
  modifications, even if the latter are not fortuitous. Cases were brought
  forward, in Chapter IV., such as the bivalve just mentioned, twenty-seven
  kinds of American trees simultaneously and similarly modified, also the
  independent production of pony breeds, and the case of the English
  greyhounds in Mexico, the offspring of which produced directly acclimated
  progeny. Besides these, the case of the Normandy pigs, of <i>Datura
  tatula</i>, and also of the black-shouldered peacock, have been spoken
  of. The teeth of the labyrinthodon, the hand of the potto, the whalebone
  of whales, the wings of birds, the climbing tendrils of some plants,
  &amp;c. have also been adduced as instances of structures, the origin and
  production of which are probably due rather to considerable modifications
  than to minute increments.</p>

  <p>It has also been shown that certain forms which were once supposed to
  be especially transitional and intermediate (as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
  aye-aye) are really by no means so; while the general rule, that the
  progress of forms has been "from the more general to the more special,"
  has been shown to present remarkable exceptions, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
  Macrauchenia, the Glyptodon, and the sabre-toothed tiger
  (Machairodus).</p>

  <p>Next, as to specific stability, it has been seen that there may <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[223]</span>be a
  certain limit to normal variability, and that if changes take place they
  may be expected <i>a priori</i> to be marked and considerable ones, from
  the facts of the inorganic world, and perhaps also of the lowest forms of
  the organic world. It has also been seen that with regard to minute
  spontaneous variations in races, there is a rapidly increasing difficulty
  in intensifying them, in any one direction, by ever such careful
  breeding. Moreover, it has appeared that different species show a
  tendency to variability in special directions, and probably in different
  degrees, and that at any rate Mr. Darwin himself concedes the existence
  of an internal barrier to change when he credits the goose with "a
  singularly inflexible organization;" also, that he admits the presence of
  an <i>internal</i> proclivity to change when he speaks of "a whole
  organization seeming to have become plastic, and tending to depart from
  the parental type."</p>

  <p>We have seen also that a marked tendency to reversion does exist,
  inasmuch as it sometimes takes place in a striking manner, as exemplified
  in the white silk fowl in England, <i>in spite of</i> careful selection
  in breeding.</p>

  <p>Again, we have seen that a tendency exists in nature to eliminate
  hybrid races, by whatever means that elimination is effected, while no
  similar tendency bars the way to an indefinite blending of varieties.
  This has also been enforced by statements as to the prepotency of certain
  pollen of identical species, but of distinct races.</p>

  <p>To all the preceding considerations have been added others derived
  from the relations of species to past time. It has been contended that we
  have as yet no evidence of minutely intermediate forms connecting
  uninterruptedly together undoubtedly distinct species. That while even
  "horse ancestry" fails to supply such a desideratum, in very strongly
  marked and exceptional kinds (such as the Ichthyosauria, Chelonia, and
  Anoura), the absence of links is very important and significant. For if
  <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>[224]</span>every species, without exception, has
  arisen by minute modifications, it seems incredible that a small
  percentage of such transitional forms should not have been preserved.
  This, of course, is especially the case as regards the marine
  Ichthyosauria and Plesiosauria, of which such numbers of remains have
  been discovered.</p>

  <p>Sir William Thomson's great authority has been seen to oppose itself
  to "Natural Selection," by limiting, on astronomical and physical
  grounds, the duration of life on this planet to about one hundred million
  years. This period, it has been contended, is not nearly enough on the
  one hand for the evolution of all organic forms by the exclusive action
  of mere minute, fortuitous variations; on the other hand, for the
  deposition of all the strata which must have been deposited, if minute
  fortuitous variation was the manner of successive specific
  manifestation.</p>

  <p>Again, the geographical distribution of existing animals has been seen
  to present difficulties which, though not themselves insurmountable, yet
  have a certain weight when taken in conjunction with all the other
  objections.</p>

  <p>The facts of homology, serial, bilateral and vertical, have also been
  passed in review. Such facts, it has been contended, are not explicable
  without admitting the action of what may most conveniently be spoken of
  as an <i>internal</i> power, the existence of which is supported by facts
  not only of comparative anatomy but of teratology and pathology also.
  "Natural Selection" also has been shown to be impotent to explain these
  phenomena, while the existence of such an internal power of homologous
  evolution diminishes the <i>a priori</i> improbability of an analogous
  law of specific origination.</p>

  <p>All these various considerations have been supplemented by an
  endeavour to show the utter inadequacy of Mr. Darwin's theory with regard
  to the higher psychical phenomena of man (especially the evolution of
  moral conceptions), and with regard to the evolution of individual
  organisms by the action of <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>[225]</span>Pangenesis. And it was implied that if Mr.
  Darwin's latter hypothesis can be shown to be untenable, an antecedent
  doubt is thus thrown upon his other conception, namely, the theory of
  "Natural Selection."</p>

  <p>A cumulative argument thus arises against the prevalent action of
  "Natural Selection," which, to the mind of the Author, is conclusive. As
  before observed, he was not originally disposed to reject Mr. Darwin's
  fascinating theory. Reiterate endeavours to solve its difficulties have,
  however, had the effect of convincing him that that theory as the one or
  as the leading explanation of the successive evolution and manifestation
  of specific forms, is untenable. At the same time he admits fully that
  "Natural Selection" acts and must act, and that it plays in the organic
  world a certain though a secondary and subordinate part.</p>

  <p>The one <i>modus operandi</i> yet suggested having been found
  insufficient, the question arises, Can another be substituted in its
  place? If not, can anything that is positive, and if anything, what, be
  said as to the question of specific origination?</p>

  <p>Now, in the first place, it is of course axiomatic that the laws which
  conditioned the evolution of extinct and of existing species are of as
  much efficacy at this moment as at any preceding period, that they
  <i>tend</i> to the manifestation of new forms as much now as ever before.
  It by no means necessarily follows, however, that this tendency is
  actually being carried into effect, and that new species of the higher
  animals and plants are actually now produced. They may be so or they may
  not, according as existing circumstances favour, or conflict with, the
  action of those laws. It is possible that lowly organized creatures may
  be continually evolved at the present day, the requisite conditions being
  more or less easily supplied. There is, however, no similar evidence at
  present as to higher forms; while, as we have seen in Chapter VII., there
  are <i>a priori</i> considerations which militate against their being
  similarly evolved. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>[226]</span></p>

  <p>The presence of wild varieties and the difficulty which often exists
  in the determination of species are sometimes adduced as arguments that
  high forms are now in process of evolution. These facts, however, do not
  necessarily prove more than that some species possess a greater
  variability than others, and (what is indeed unquestionable) that species
  have often been unduly multiplied by geologists and botanists. It may be,
  for example, that Wagner was right, and that all the American monkeys of
  the genus cebus may be reduced to a single species or to two.</p>

  <p>With regard to the lower organisms, and supposing views recently
  advanced to become fully established, there is no reason to think that
  the forms said to be evolved were new species, but rather reappearances
  of definite kinds which had appeared before and will appear again under
  the same conditions. In the same way, with higher forms similar
  conditions must educe similar results, but here practically similar
  conditions can rarely obtain because of the large part which "descent"
  and "inheritance" always play in such highly organized forms.</p>

  <p>Still it is conceivable that different combinations at different times
  may have occasionally the same outcome just as the multiplications of
  different numbers may have severally the same result.</p>

  <p>There are reasons, however, for thinking it possible that the human
  race is a witness of an exceptionally unchanging and stable condition of
  things, if the calculations of Mr. Croll are valid as to how far
  variations in the eccentricity in the earth's orbit together with the
  precession of the equinoxes have produced changes in climate. Mr. Wallace
  has pointed out<a name="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> that
  the last 60,000 years having been exceptionally unchanging as <!-- Page
  227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[227]</span>regards
  these conditions, specific evolution may have been exceptionally rare. It
  becomes then possible to suppose that for a similar period stimuli to
  change in the manifestation of animal forms may have been exceptionally
  few and feeble,&mdash;that is, if the conditions of the earth's orbit
  have been as exceptional as stated. However, even if new species are
  actually now being evolved as actively as ever, or if they have been so
  quite recently, no conflict thence necessarily arises with the view here
  advocated. For it by no means follows that if some examples of new
  species have recently been suddenly produced from individuals of
  antecedent species, we ought to be able to put our fingers on such cases;
  as Mr. Murphy well observes<a name="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> in a passage before quoted, "If a
  species were to come suddenly into being in the wild state, as the Ancon
  sheep did under domestication, how could we ascertain the fact? If the
  first of a newly-born species were found, the fact of its discovery would
  tell nothing about its origin. Naturalists would register it as a very
  rare species, having been only once met with, but they would have no
  means of knowing whether it were the first or the last of its race."</p>

  <p>But are there any grounds for thinking that in the genesis of species
  an <i>internal</i> force or tendency interferes, co-operates with and
  controls the action of external conditions?</p>

  <p>It is here contended that there are such grounds, and that though
  inheritance, reversion, atavism, Natural Selection, &amp;c., play a part
  not unimportant, yet that such an internal power is a great, perhaps the
  main, determining agent.</p>

  <p>It will, however, be replied that such an entity is no <i>vera
  causa</i>; that if the conception is accepted, it is no real explanation;
  and that it is merely a roundabout way of saying that the facts are as
  they are, while the cause remains unknown. To this it may be rejoined
  that for all who believe in the existence of the <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>[228]</span>abstraction "force" at
  all, other than will, this conception of an internal force must be
  accepted and located somewhere&mdash;cannot be eliminated altogether; and
  that therefore it may as reasonably be accepted in this mode as in any
  other.</p>

  <p>It was urged at the end of the third chapter that it is congruous to
  credit mineral species with an internal power or force. By such a power
  it may be conceived that crystals not only assume their external
  symmetry, but even repair it when injured. Ultimate chemical elements
  must also be conceived as possessing an innate tendency to form certain
  unions, and to cohere in stable aggregations. This was considered towards
  the end of Chapter VIII.</p>

  <p>Turning to the organic world, even on the hypothesis of Mr. Herbert
  Spencer or that of Mr. Darwin, it is impossible to escape the conception
  of innate internal forces. With regard to the physiological units of the
  former, Mr. Spencer himself, as we have seen, distinctly attributes to
  them "an <i>innate</i> tendency" to evolve the parent form from which
  they sprang. With regard to the gemmules of Mr. Darwin, we have seen, in
  Chapter X., with how many innate powers, tendencies, and capabilities
  they must each be severally endowed, to reproduce their kind, to evolve
  complex organisms or cells, to exercise germinative affinity, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>If then (as was before said at the end of Chapter VIII.) such innate
  powers must be attributed to chemical atoms, to mineral species, to
  gemmules, and to physiological units, it is only reasonable to attribute
  such to each individual organism.</p>

  <p>The conception of such internal and latent capabilities is somewhat
  like that of Mr. Galton, before mentioned, according to which the organic
  world consists of entities, each of which is, as it were, a spheroid with
  many facets on its surface, upon one of which it reposes in stable
  equilibrium. When by the accumulated action of incident forces this
  equilibrium is <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>[229]</span>disturbed, the spheroid is supposed to
  turn over until it settles on an adjacent facet once more in stable
  equilibrium.</p>

  <p>The internal tendency of an organism to certain considerable and
  definite changes would correspond to the facets on the surface of the
  spheroid.</p>

  <p>It may be objected that we have no knowledge as to how terrestrial,
  cosmical and other forces can affect organisms so as to stimulate and
  evolve these latent, merely potential forms. But we have had evidence
  that such mysterious agencies <i>do</i> affect organisms in ways as yet
  inexplicable, in the very remarkable effects of geographical conditions
  which were detailed in the third chapter.</p>

  <p>It is quite conceivable that the material organic world may be so
  constituted that the simultaneous action upon it of all known forces,
  mechanical, physical, chemical, magnetic, terrestrial, and cosmical,
  together with other as yet unknown forces which probably exist, may
  result in changes which are harmonious and symmetrical, just as the
  internal nature of vibrating plates causes particles of sand scattered
  over them to assume definite and symmetrical figures when made to
  oscillate in different ways by the bow of a violin being drawn along
  their edges. The results of these combined internal powers and external
  influences might be represented under the symbol of complex series of
  vibrations (analogous to those of sound or light) forming a most complex
  harmony or a display of most varied colours. In such a way the reparation
  of local injuries might be symbolized as a filling up and completion of
  an interrupted rhythm. Thus also monstrous aberrations from typical
  structure might correspond to a discord, and sterility from crossing be
  compared with the darkness resulting from the interference of waves of
  light.</p>

  <p>Such symbolism will harmonize with the peculiar reproduction, before
  mentioned, of heads in the body of certain annelids, with the facts of
  serial homology, as well as those of bilateral and <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[230]</span>vertical symmetry.
  Also, as the atoms of a resonant body may be made to give out sound by
  the juxtaposition of a vibrating tuning-fork, so it is conceivable that
  the physiological units of a living organism may be so influenced by
  surrounding conditions (organic and other) that the accumulation of these
  conditions may upset the previous rhythm of such units, producing
  modifications in them&mdash;a fresh chord in the harmony of
  nature&mdash;a new species!</p>

  <p>But it may be again objected that to say that species arise by the
  help of an innate power possessed by organisms is no explanation, but is
  a reproduction of the absurdity, <i>l'opium endormit parcequ'il a une
  vertu soporifique</i>. It is contended, however, that this objection does
  not apply, even if it be conceded that there is that force in Molière's
  ridicule which is generally attributed to it.<a name="NtA_231"
  href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> Much, however, might be said in
  opposition to more than one of that brilliant dramatist's smart
  philosophical epigrams, just as to the theological ones of Voltaire, or
  to the biological one of that other Frenchman who for a time discredited
  a cranial skeletal theory by the phrase "Vertèbre pensante."<a
  name="NtA_232" href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In fact, however, it is a real explanation of how a man lives to say
  that he lives independently, on his own income, instead of being
  supported by his relatives and friends. In the same way, there is fully
  as real a distinction between the production of new specific
  manifestations entirely <i>ab externo</i>, and by the production of the
  same through an innate force and tendency, <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span>the determination of
  which into action is occasioned by external circumstances.</p>

  <p>To say that organisms possess this innate power, and that by it new
  species are from time to time produced, is by no means a mere assertion
  that they <i>are</i> produced, and in an unknown mode. It is the negation
  of that view which deems external forces alone sufficient, and at the
  same time the assertion of something positive, to be arrived at by the
  process of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p>

  <p>All physical explanations result ultimately in such conceptions of
  innate power, or else in that of will force. The far-famed explanation of
  the celestial motions ends in the conception that every particle of
  matter has the innate power of attracting every other particle directly
  as the mass, and inversely as the square of the distance.</p>

  <p>We are logically driven to this positive conception if we do not
  accept the view that there is no force but volition, and that all
  phenomena whatever are the immediate results of the action of intelligent
  and self-conscious will.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the notion of sudden changes&mdash;saltatory actions
  in nature&mdash;has received countenance from Professor Huxley.<a
  name="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> We must conceive that
  these jumps are orderly, and according to law, inasmuch as the whole
  cosmos is such. Such orderly evolution harmonizes with a teleology
  derived, not indeed from external nature directly, but from the mind of
  man. On this point, however, more will be said in the next chapter. But,
  once more, if new species are not manifested by the action of external
  conditions upon minute indefinite individual differences, in what precise
  way may we conceive that manifestation to have taken place?</p>

  <p>Are new species now evolving, as they have been from time to time
  evolved? If so, in what way and by what conceivable means?</p>

<p><!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>[232]</span></p>

  <p>In the first place, they must be produced by natural action in
  pre-existing material, or by supernatural action.</p>

  <p>For reasons to be given in the next chapter, the second hypothesis
  need not be considered.</p>

  <p>If, then, new species are and have been evolved from pre-existing
  material, must that material have been organic or inorganic?</p>

  <p>As before said, additional arguments have lately been brought forward
  to show that individual organisms <i>do</i> arise from a basis of
  <i>in</i>-organic material only. As, however, this at the most appears to
  be the case, if at all, only with the lowest and most minute organisms
  exclusively, the process cannot be observed, though it may perhaps be
  fairly inferred.</p>

  <p>We may therefore, if for no other reason, dismiss the notion that
  highly organized animals and plants can be suddenly or gradually built up
  by any combination of physical forces and natural powers acting
  externally and internally upon and in merely inorganic material as a
  base.</p>

  <p>But the question is, how have the highest kinds of animals and plants
  arisen? It seems impossible that they can have appeared otherwise than by
  the agency of antecedent organisms not greatly different from them.</p>

  <p>A multitude of facts, ever increasing in number and importance, all
  point to such a mode of specific manifestation.</p>

  <p>One very good example has been adduced by Professor Flower in the
  introductory lecture of his first Hunterian Course.<a name="NtA_234"
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> It is the reduction in size, to a
  greater or less degree, of the second and third digits of the foot in
  Australian marsupials, and this, in spite of the very different form and
  function of the foot in different groups of those animals.</p>

  <p>A similarly significant evidence of relationship is afforded by
  processes of the zygomatic region of the skull in certain edentates
  existing and extinct.</p>

<p><!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>[233]</span></p>

  <p>Again, the relation between existing and recent faunas of the
  different regions of the world, and the predominating (though by no means
  exclusive) march of organization, from the more general to the more
  special, point in the same direction.</p>

  <p>Almost all the facts brought forward by the patient industry of Mr.
  Darwin in support of his theory of "Natural Selection," are of course
  available as evidence in favour of the agency of pre-existing and similar
  animals in specific evolution.</p>

  <p>Now the new forms must be produced by changes taking place in
  organisms in, after or before their birth, either in their embryonic, or
  towards or in their adult, condition.</p>

  <p>Examples of strange births are sufficiently common, and they may arise
  either from direct embryonic modifications or apparently from some
  obscure change in the parental action. To the former category belong the
  hosts of instances of malformation through arrest of development, and
  perhaps generally monstrosities of some sort are the result of such
  affections of the embryo. To the second category belong all cases of
  hybridism, of cross breed, and in all probability the new varieties and
  forms, such as the memorable one of the black-shouldered peacock. In all
  these cases we do not have abortions or monstrosities, but more or less
  harmonious forms often of great functional activity, endowed with marked
  viability and generative prepotency, except in the case of hybrids, when
  we often find even a more marked generative impotency.</p>

  <p>It seems probable therefore that new species may arise from some
  constitutional affection of parental forms&mdash;an affection mainly, if
  not exclusively, of their generative system. Mr. Darwin has carefully
  collected<a name="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> numerous
  instances to show how excessively sensitive to various influences this
  system is. He says:<a name="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>
  "Sterility is independent of general health, and is often <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[234]</span>accompanied by
  excess of size, or great luxuriance," and, "No one can tell, till he
  tries; whether any particular animal will breed under confinement, or any
  exotic plant seed freely under culture." Again, "When a new character
  arises, whatever its nature may be, it generally tends to be inherited,
  at least in a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner."<a
  name="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> Yet the obscure action
  of conditions will alter characters long inherited, as the grandchildren
  of Aylesbury ducks, removed to a distant part of England, completely lost
  their early habit of incubation, and hatched their eggs at the same time
  with the common ducks of the same place.<a name="NtA_238"
  href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin quotes Mr. Bartlett as saying: "It is remarkable that lions
  breed more freely in travelling collections than in the zoological
  gardens; probably the constant excitement and irritation produced by
  moving from place to place, or change of air, may have considerable
  influence in the matter."<a name="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin also says: "There is reason to believe that insects are
  affected by confinement like the higher animals," and he gives
  examples.<a name="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Again, he gives examples of change of plumage in the linnet, bunting,
  oriole, and other birds, and of the temporary modification of the horns
  of a male deer during a voyage.<a name="NtA_241"
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Finally, he adds that these changes cannot be attributed to loss of
  health or vigour, "when we reflect how healthy, long-lived, and vigorous
  many animals are under captivity, such as parrots, and hawks when used
  for hawking, chetahs when used for hunting, and elephants. The
  reproductive organs themselves are not diseased; and the diseases from
  which animals in menageries usually perish, are not those which in any
  way affect their fertility. No domestic animal is more subject to disease
  than the sheep, yet it is remarkably prolific.... It would appear <!--
  Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>[235]</span>that
  any change in the habits of life, whatever these habits may be, if great
  enough, tends to affect in an inexplicable manner the powers of
  reproduction."</p>

  <p>Such, then, is the singular sensitiveness of the generative
  system.</p>

  <p>As to the means by which that system is affected, we see that a
  variety of conditions affect it; but as to the modes in which they act
  upon it, we have as yet little if any clue.</p>

  <p>We have also seen the singular effects (in tailed Lepidoptera,
  &amp;c.) of causes connected with geographical distribution, the mode of
  action of which is as yet quite inexplicable; and we have also seen the
  innate tendency which there appears to be in certain groups (birds of
  paradise, &amp;c.) to develop peculiarities of a special kind.</p>

  <p>It is, to say the least, probable that other influences exist,
  terrestrial and cosmical, as yet un-noted. The gradually accumulating or
  diversely combining actions of all these on highly sensitive structures,
  which are themselves possessed of internal responsive powers and
  tendencies, may well result in occasional repeated productions of forms
  harmonious and vigorous, and differing from the parental forms in
  proportion to the result of the combining or conflicting action of all
  external and internal influences.</p>

  <p>If, in the past history of this planet, more causes ever intervened,
  or intervened more energetically than at present, we might <i>a
  priori</i> expect a richer and more various evolution of forms more
  radically differing than any which could be produced under conditions of
  more perfect equilibrium. At the same time, if it be true that the last
  few thousand years have been a period of remarkable and exceptional
  uniformity as regards this planet's astronomical relations, there are
  then some grounds for thinking that organic evolution may have been
  exceptionally depressed during the same epoch.</p>

  <p>Now, as to the fact that sudden changes and sudden <!-- Page 236
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>[236]</span>developments
  have occurred, and as to the probability that such changes are likely to
  occur, evidence was given in Chapter IV.</p>

  <p>In Chapter V. we also saw that minerals become modified suddenly and
  considerably by the action of incident forces&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
  production of hexagonal tabular crystals of carbonate of copper by
  sulphuric acid, and of long rectangular prisms by ammonia, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>We have thus a certain antecedent probability that if changes are
  produced in specific manifestation through incident forces, these changes
  will be sensible and considerable, not minute and infinitesimal.</p>

  <p>Consequently, it is probable that new species have appeared from time
  to time with comparative suddenness, and that they still continue so to
  arise if all the conditions necessary for specific evolution now
  obtain.</p>

  <p>This probability will be increased if the observations of Dr. Bastian
  are confirmed by future investigation. According to his report, when the
  requisite conditions were supplied, the transformations which appeared to
  take place (from very low to higher organisms) were sudden, definite, and
  complete.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if this is so, there must probably exist in higher forms a
  similar tendency to such change. That tendency may indeed be long
  suppressed, and ultimately modified by the action of heredity&mdash;an
  action which would increase in force with the increase in the perfection
  and complexity of the organism affected. Still we might expect that such
  changes as do take place would be also sudden, definite, and
  complete.</p>

  <p>Moreover, as the same causes produce the same effects, several
  individual parent forms must often have been similarly and simultaneously
  affected. That they should be so affected&mdash;at least that several
  similarly modified individuals should simultaneously arise&mdash;has been
  seen to be a generally necessary circumstance for the permanent duration
  of such new modifications.</p>

  <p>It is also conceivable that such new forms may be endowed <!-- Page
  237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[237]</span>with
  excessive constitutional strength and viability, and with generative
  prepotency, as was the case with the black-shouldered peacock in Sir J.
  Trevelyan's flock. This flock was entirely composed of the common kind,
  and yet the new form rapidly developed itself "<i>to the extinction of
  the previously existing breed</i>."<a name="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Indeed, the notion accepted by both Mr. Darwin and Mr. Herbert
  Spencer, and which is plainly the fact (namely, that changes of
  conditions and incident forces, within limits, augment the viability and
  fertility of individuals), harmonizes well with the suggested possibility
  as to an augmented viability and prepotency in new organic forms evolved
  by peculiar consentaneous actions of conditions and forces, both external
  and internal.</p>

  <p>The remarkable series of changes noted by Dr. Bastian were certainly
  not produced by external incident forces <i>only</i>, but by these acting
  on a peculiar <i>materia</i>, having special properties and powers.
  Therefore, the changes were induced by the consentaneous action of
  internal and external forces.<a name="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> In the same way then, we may expect
  changes in higher forms to be evolved by similar united action of
  internal and external forces.</p>

  <p>One other point may here be alluded to. When the remarkable way in
  which structure and function simultaneously change, is borne in mind;
  when those numerous instances in which nature has supplied similar wants
  by similar means, as detailed in Chapter III., are remembered; when also
  all the wonderful contrivances of orchids, of mimicry, and the strange
  complexity of certain instinctive actions are considered: then the
  conviction forces itself on many minds that the organic world is the
  expression of an intelligence of some kind. This view has been well
  advocated by Mr. Joseph John Murphy, in his recent work so often here
  referred to.</p>

<p><!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[238]</span></p>

  <p>This intelligence, however, is evidently not altogether such as ours,
  or else has other ends in view than those most obvious to us. For the end
  is often attained in singularly roundabout ways, or with a prodigality of
  means which seems out of all proportion with the result: not with the
  simple action directed to one end which generally marks human
  activity.</p>

  <p>Organic nature then speaks clearly to many minds of the action of an
  intelligence resulting, on the whole and in the main, in order, harmony,
  and beauty, yet of an intelligence the ways of which are not such as
  ours.</p>

  <p>This view of evolution harmonizes well with Theistic conceptions; not,
  of course, that this harmony is brought forward as an argument in its
  favour generally, but it will have weight with those who are convinced
  that Theism reposes upon solid grounds of reason as <i>the</i> rational
  view of the universe. To such it may be observed that, thus conceived,
  the Divine action has that slight amount of resemblance to, and that wide
  amount of divergence from what human action would be, which might be
  expected <i>a priori</i>&mdash;might be expected, that is, from a Being
  whose nature and aims are utterly beyond our power to imagine, however
  faintly, but whose truth and goodness are the fountain and source of our
  own perceptions of such qualities.</p>

  <p>The view of evolution maintained in this work, though arrived at in
  complete independence, yet seems to agree in many respects with the views
  advocated by Professor Owen in the last volume of his "Anatomy of
  Vertebrates," under the term "derivation." He says:<a name="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> "Derivation holds that every species
  changes in time, by virtue of inherent tendencies thereto. 'Natural
  Selection' holds that no such change can take place without the influence
  of altered external circumstances.<a name="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>[239]</span>'Derivation' sees among
  the effects of the innate tendency to change irrespective of altered
  circumstances, a manifestation of creative power in the variety and
  beauty of the results; and, in the ultimate forthcoming of a being
  susceptible of appreciating such beauty, evidence of the pre-ordaining of
  such relation of power to the appreciation. 'Natural Selection'
  acknowledges that if ornament or beauty, in itself, should be a purpose
  in creation, it would be absolutely fatal to it as a hypothesis."</p>

  <p>"'Natural Selection' sees grandeur in the view of life, with its
  several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few
  forms or into one. 'Derivation' sees therein a narrow invocation of a
  special miracle and an unworthy limitation of creative power, the
  grandeur of which is manifested daily, hourly, in calling into life many
  forms, by conversion of physical and chemical into vital modes of force,
  under as many diversified conditions of the requisite elements to be so
  combined."</p>

  <p>The view propounded in this work allows, however, a greater and more
  important part to the share of external influences, it being believed by
  the Author, however, that these external influences equally with the
  internal ones are the results of one harmonious action underlying the
  whole of nature, organic and inorganic, cosmical, physical, chemical,
  terrestrial, vital, and social.</p>

  <p>According to this view, an internal law presides over the actions of
  every part of every individual, and of every organism as a unit, and of
  the entire organic world as a whole. It is believed that this conception
  of an internal innate force will ever remain necessary, however much its
  subordinate processes and actions may become explicable:</p>

  <p>That by such a force, from time to time, new species are manifested by
  ordinary generation just as <i>Pavo nigripennis</i> appeared suddenly,
  these new forms not being monstrosities but harmonious self-consistent
  wholes. That thus, as specific distinctness <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>[240]</span>is manifested by
  obscure sexual conditions, so in obscure sexual modifications specific
  distinctions arise.</p>

  <p>That these "jumps" are considerable in comparison with the minute
  variations of "Natural Selection"&mdash;are in fact sensible steps, such
  as discriminate species from species.</p>

  <p>That the latent tendency which exists to these sudden evolutions is
  determined to action by the stimulus of external conditions.</p>

  <p>That "Natural Selection" rigorously destroys monstrosities, and
  abortive and feeble attempts at the performance of the evolutionary
  process.</p>

  <p>That "Natural Selection" removes the antecedent species rapidly when
  the new one evolved is more in harmony with surrounding conditions.</p>

  <p>That "Natural Selection" favours and develops useful variations,
  though it is impotent to originate them or to erect the physiological
  barrier which seems to exist between species.</p>

  <p>By some such conception as this, the difficulties here enumerated,
  which beset the theory of "Natural Selection" pure and simple, are to be
  got over.</p>

  <p>Thus, for example, the difficulties discussed in the first
  chapter&mdash;namely, those as to the origins and first beginnings of
  certain structures&mdash;are completely evaded.</p>

  <p>Again, as to the independent origin of closely similar structures,
  such as the eyes of the Vertebrata and cuttle-fishes, the difficulty is
  removed if we may adopt the conception of an innate force similarly
  directed in each case, and assisted by favourable external
  conditions.</p>

  <p>Specific stability, limitation to variability, and the facts of
  reversion, all harmonize with the view here put forward. The same may be
  said with regard to the significant facts of homology, and of organic
  symmetry; and our consideration of the hypothesis of Pangenesis in
  Chapter X., has seemed to result in a view as to innate powers which
  accords well with what is here advocated. <!-- Page 241 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>[241]</span></p>

  <p>The evolutionary hypothesis here advocated also serves to explain all
  those remarkable facts which were stated in the first chapter to be
  explicable by the theory of Natural Selection, namely, the relation of
  existing to recent faunas and floras; the phenomena of homology and of
  rudimentary structures; also the processes gone through in development;
  and lastly, the wonderful facts of mimicry.</p>

  <p>Finally, the view adopted is the synthesis of many distinct and, at
  first sight, conflicting conceptions, each of which contains elements of
  truth, and all of which it appears to be able more or less to
  harmonize.</p>

  <p>Thus it has been seen that "Natural Selection" is accepted. It acts
  and must act, though alone it does not appear capable of fulfilling the
  task assigned to it by Mr. Darwin.</p>

  <p>Pangenesis has probably also much truth in it, and has certainly
  afforded valuable and pregnant suggestions, but unaided and alone it
  seems inadequate to explain the evolution of the individual organism.</p>

  <p>Those three conceptions of the organic world which may be spoken of as
  the teleological, the typical, and the transmutationist, have often been
  regarded as mutually antagonistic and conflicting.</p>

  <p>The genesis of species as here conceived, however, accepts, locates,
  and harmonizes all the three.</p>

  <p>Teleology concerns the ends for which organisms were designed. The
  recognition, therefore, that their formation took place by an evolution
  not fortuitous, in no way invalidates the acknowledgment of their final
  causes if on other grounds there are reasons for believing that such
  final causes exist.</p>

  <p>Conformity to type, or the creation of species according to certain
  "divine ideas," is in no way interfered with by such a process of
  evolution as is here advocated. Such "divine ideas" must be accepted or
  declined upon quite other grounds than the mode of their realization, and
  of their manifestation in the world of sensible phenomena. <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[242]</span></p>

  <p>Transmutationism (an old name for the evolutionary hypothesis), which
  was conceived at one time to be the very antithesis to the two preceding
  conceptions, harmonizes well with them if the evolution be conceived to
  be orderly and designed. It will in the next chapter be shown to be
  completely in harmony with conceptions, upon the acceptance of which
  "final causes" and "divine ideal archetypes" alike depend.</p>

  <p>Thus then, if the cumulative argument put forward in this book is
  valid, we must admit the insufficiency of Natural Selection both on
  account of the residuary phenomena it fails to explain, and on account of
  certain other phenomena which seem actually to conflict with that theory.
  We have seen that though the laws of nature are constant, yet some of the
  conditions which determine specific change may be exceptionally absent at
  the present epoch of the world's history; also that it is not only
  possible, but highly probable, that an internal power or tendency is an
  important if not the main agent in evoking the manifestation of new
  species on the scene of realized existence, and that in any case, from
  the facts of homology, innate internal powers to the full as mysterious
  must anyhow be accepted, whether they act in specific origination or not.
  Besides all this, we have seen that it is probable that the action of
  this innate power is stimulated, evoked, and determined by external
  conditions, and also that the same external conditions, in the shape of
  "Natural Selection," play an important part in the evolutionary process:
  and finally, it has been affirmed that the view here advocated, while it
  is supported by the facts on which Darwinism rests, is not open to the
  objections and difficulties which oppose themselves to the reception of
  "Natural Selection," as the exclusive or even as the main agent in the
  successive and orderly evolution of organic forms in the <i>genesis of
  species</i>. <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a

</blockquote>

  <p>The special "Darwinian Theory" and that of an evolutionary process
  neither excessively minute nor fortuitous, having now been considered, it
  is time to turn to the important question, whether both or either of
  these conceptions may have any bearing, and if any, what, upon Christian
  belief?</p>

  <p>Some readers will consider such an inquiry to be a work of
  supererogation. Seeing clearly themselves the absurdity of prevalent
  popular views, and the shallowness of popular objections, they may be
  impatient of any discussion, on the <!-- Page 244 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>[244]</span>subject. But it is
  submitted that there are many minds worthy of the highest esteem and of
  every consideration, which have regarded the subject hitherto almost
  exclusively from one point of view; that there are some persons who are
  opposed to the progress (in their own minds or in that of their children
  or dependents) of physical scientific truth&mdash;the natural
  revelation&mdash;through a mistaken estimate of its religious bearings,
  while there are others who are zealous in its promotion from a precisely
  similar error. For the sake of both these then the Author may perhaps be
  pardoned for entering slightly on very elementary matters relating to the
  question, whether evolution or Darwinism have any, and if any, what,
  bearing on theology?</p>

  <p>There are at least two classes of men who will certainly assert that
  they have a very important and highly significant bearing upon it.</p>

  <p>One of these classes consists of persons zealous for religion indeed,
  but who identify orthodoxy with their own private interpretation of
  Scripture or with narrow opinions in which they have been brought
  up&mdash;opinions doubtless widely spread, but at the same time destitute
  of any distinct and authoritative sanction on the part of the Christian
  Church.</p>

  <p>The other class is made up of men hostile to religion, and who are
  glad to make use of any and every argument which they think may possibly
  be available against it.</p>

  <p>Some individuals within this latter class may not believe in the
  existence of God, but may yet abstain from publicly avowing this absence
  of belief, contenting themselves with denials of "creation" and "design,"
  though these denials are really consequences of their attitude of mind
  respecting the most important and fundamental of all beliefs.</p>

  <p>Without a distinct belief in a personal God it is impossible to have
  any religion worthy of the name, and no one can at the same time accept
  the Christian religion and deny the dogma of creation. <!-- Page 245
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[245]</span></p>

  <p>"I believe in God," "the Creator of Heaven and Earth," the very first
  clauses of the Apostles' Creed, formally commit those who accept them to
  the assertion of this belief. If, therefore, any theory of physical
  science really conflicts with such an authoritative statement, its
  importance to Christians is unquestionable.</p>

  <p>As, however, "creation" forms a part of "revelation," and as
  "revelation" appeals for its acceptance to "reason" which has to prepare
  a basis for it by an intelligent acceptance of theism on <i>purely
  rational grounds</i>, it is necessary to start with a few words as to the
  reasonableness of belief in God, which indeed are less superfluous than
  some readers may perhaps imagine; "a few words," because this is not the
  place where the argument can be drawn out, but only one or two hints
  given in reply to certain modern objections.</p>

  <p>No better example perhaps can be taken, as a type of these objections,
  than a passage in Mr. Herbert Spencer's First Principles.<a
  name="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> This author constantly
  speaks of the "ultimate cause of things" as "the Unknowable," a term
  singularly unfortunate, and as Mr. James Martineau has pointed out,<a
  name="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> even <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>[246]</span>self-contradictory: for that entity, the
  knowledge of the existence of which presses itself ever more and more
  upon the cultivated intellect, cannot be the unknown, still less <i>the
  unknowable</i>, because we certainly know it, in that we know for certain
  that it exists. Nay more, to predicate incognoscibility of it, is even a
  certain knowledge of the mode of its existence. Mr. H. Spencer says:<a
  name="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> "The consciousness of
  an Inscrutable Power manifested to us through all phenomena has been
  growing ever clearer; and must eventually be freed from its
  imperfections. The certainty that on the one hand such a Power exists,
  while on the other hand its nature transcends intuition, and is beyond
  imagination, is the certainty towards which intelligence has from the
  first been progressing." One would think then that the familiar and
  accepted word "the Inscrutable" (which is in this passage actually
  employed, and to which no theologian would object) would be an
  indefinitely better term than "the unknowable." The above extract has,
  however, such a theistic aspect that some readers may think the
  opposition here offered superfluous; it may be well, therefore, to quote
  two other sentences. In another place he observes,<a name="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> "Passing over the consideration of
  credibility, and confining ourselves to that of conceivability, we see
  that atheism, pantheism, and theism, when rigorously analysed, severally
  prove to be absolutely unthinkable;" and speaking of "every form of
  religion," he adds,<a name="NtA_250" href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a>
  "The analysis of every possible hypothesis proves, not simply that no
  hypothesis is sufficient but that no hypothesis is even thinkable." The
  unknowable is admitted to be a power which cannot be regarded as having
  sympathy with us, but as one to which no emotion whatever <!-- Page 247
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[247]</span>can be
  ascribed, and we are expressly forbidden "by <i>duty</i>," to affirm
  personality of God as much as to deny it of Him. How such a being can be
  presented as an object on which to exercise religious emotion it is
  difficult indeed to understand.<a name="NtA_251"
  href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> Aspiration, love, devotion to be
  poured forth upon what we can never know, upon what we can never affirm
  to know, or care for, us, our thoughts or actions, or to possess the
  attributes of wisdom and goodness! The worship offered in such a religion
  must be, as Professor Huxley says,<a name="NtA_252"
  href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> "for the most part of the silent
  sort"&mdash;silent not only as to the spoken word, but silent as to the
  mental conception also. It will be difficult to distinguish the follower
  of this religion from the follower of none, and the man who declines
  either to assert or to deny the existence of God, is practically in the
  position of an atheist. For theism enjoins the cultivation of sentiments
  of love and devotion to God, and the practice of their external
  expression. Atheism forbids both, while the simply non-theist abstains in
  conformity with the prohibition of the atheist and thus practically sides
  with him. Moreover, since man cannot imagine that of which he has no
  experience in any way whatever, and since he has experience only of
  <i>human</i> perfections and of the powers and properties of
  <i>inferior</i> existences; if he be required to deny human perfections
  and to abstain from making use of such conceptions, he is thereby
  necessarily reduced to others of an inferior order. <!-- Page 248
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[248]</span>Mr. H. Spencer
  says,<a name="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> "Those who
  espouse this alternative position, make the erroneous assumption that the
  choice is between personality and something lower than personality;
  whereas the choice is rather between personality and something higher. Is
  it not just possible that there is a mode of being as much transcending
  intelligence and will, as these transcend mechanical motion?"</p>

  <p>"It is true we are totally unable to conceive any such higher mode of
  being. But this is not a reason for questioning its existence; it is
  rather the reverse." "May we not therefore rightly refrain from assigning
  to the 'ultimate cause' any attributes whatever, on the ground that such
  attributes, derived as they must be from our own natures, are not
  elevations but degradations?" The way however to arrive at the object
  aimed at (<i>i.e</i>. to obtain the best attainable conception of the
  First Cause) is not to refrain from <i>the only conceptions possible to
  us</i>, but to seek the very highest of these, and then declare their
  utter inadequacy; and this is precisely the course which has been pursued
  by theologians. It is to be regretted that before writing on this matter
  Mr. Spencer did not more thoroughly acquaint himself with the ordinary
  doctrine on the subject. It is always taught in the Church schools of
  divinity, that nothing, not even <i>existence</i>, is to be predicated
  <i>univocally</i> of "God" and "creatures;" that after exhausting
  ingenuity to arrive at the loftiest possible conceptions, we must declare
  them to be <i>utterly inadequate</i>; that, after all, they are but
  accommodations to human infirmity; that they are in a sense objectively
  false (because of their inadequacy), though subjectively and very
  practically true. But the difference between this mode of treatment and
  that adopted by Mr. Spencer is wide indeed; for the practical result of
  the mode inculcated by the Church is that each one may freely affirm and
  act upon <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>[249]</span>the highest human conceptions he can
  attain of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, His watchful care, His
  loving providence for every man, at every moment and in every need; for
  the Christian knows that the falseness of his conceptions lies only in
  their <i>inadequacy</i>; he may therefore strengthen and refresh himself,
  may rejoice and revel in conceptions of the goodness of God, drawn from
  the tenderest human images of fatherly care and love, or he may chasten
  and abase himself by consideration of the awful holiness and
  unapproachable majesty of the Divinity derived from analogous sources,
  knowing that no thought of man can ever be <i>true enough</i>, can ever
  attain the incomprehensible reality, which nevertheless really <i>is</i>
  all that can be conceived, <i>plus</i> an inconceivable infinity
  beyond.</p>

  <p>A good illustration of what is here meant, and of the difference
  between the theistic position and Mr. Spencer's, may be supplied by an
  example he has himself proposed. Thus,<a name="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> he imagines an intelligent watch
  speculating as to its maker, and conceiving of him in terms of
  watch-being, and figuring him as furnished with springs, escapements,
  cogged wheels, &amp;c., his motions facilitated by oil&mdash;in a word,
  like himself. It is assumed by Mr. Spencer that this necessary watch
  conception would be completely false, and the illustration is made use of
  to show "the presumption of theologians"&mdash;the absurdity and
  unreasonableness of those men who figure the incomprehensible cause of
  all phenomena as a Being in some way comparable with man. Now, putting
  aside for the moment all other considerations, and accepting the
  illustration, surely the example demonstrates rather the unreasonableness
  of the <i>objector himself</i>! It is true, indeed, that a man is an
  organism indefinitely more complex and perfect than any watch; but if the
  watch could only conceive of its maker in watch terms, or else in terms
  altogether inferior, the watch would plainly be right in speaking of <!--
  Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>[250]</span>its
  maker as a, to it, inconceivably perfect kind of watch, acknowledging at
  the same time, that this, its conception of him, was <i>utterly
  inadequate</i>, although the best its inferior nature allowed it to form.
  For if, instead of so conceiving of its maker, it refused to make use of
  these relative perfections as a makeshift, and so necessarily thought of
  him as amorphous metal, or mere oil, or by the help of any other inferior
  conception which a watch might be imagined capable of entertaining, that
  watch would he wrong indeed. For man can much more properly be compared
  with, and has much more affinity to, a perfect watch in full activity
  than to a mere piece of metal, or drop of oil. But the watch is even more
  in the right still, for its maker, man, virtually <i>has</i> the cogged
  wheels, springs, escapements, oil, &amp;c., which the watch's conception
  has been supposed to attribute to him; inasmuch as all these parts must
  have existed as distinct ideas in the human watchmaker's mind before he
  could actually construct the clock formed by him. Nor is even this all,
  for, by the hypothesis, the watch <i>thinks</i>. It must, therefore,
  think of its maker as "a thinking being," and in this it is <i>absolutely
  and completely right</i>.<a name="NtA_255"
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> Either, therefore, the hypothesis is
  <i>absurd</i> or it actually <i>demonstrates the very position it was
  chosen to refute</i>. Unquestionably, then, on the mere ground taken by
  Mr. Herbert Spencer himself, if we are compelled to think of the First
  Cause either in human terms (but with human imperfections abstracted and
  human perfections carried to the highest conceivable degree), or, on the
  other hand, in terms decidedly inferior, such as those are driven to who
  think of Him, but decline to accept as a help the term "personality;"
  there can be no question but that the first conception is immeasurably
  nearer the truth than the second. Yet the latter is the one put forward
  and advocated by that author in spite of its unreasonableness, and in
  spite also <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>[251]</span>of its conflicting with the whole moral
  nature of man and all his noblest aspirations.</p>

  <p>Again, Mr. Herbert Spencer objects to the conception of God as "first
  cause," on the ground that "when our symbolic conceptions are such that
  no cumulative or indirect processes of thought can enable us to ascertain
  that there are corresponding actualities, nor any predictions be made
  whose fulfilment can prove this, then they are altogether vicious and
  illusive, and in no way distinguishable from pure fictions."<a
  name="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now, it is quite true that "symbolic conceptions," which are not to be
  justified either (1) by presentations of sense, or (2) by intuitions, are
  invalid as representations of real truth. Yet the conception of God
  referred to <i>is</i> justified by our primary intuitions, and we can
  assure ourselves that it <i>does</i> stand for an actuality by comparing
  it with (1) our intuitions of free-will and causation, and (2) our
  intuitions of morality and responsibility. That we <i>have</i> these
  intuitions is a point on which the Author joins issue with Mr. Spencer,
  and confidently affirms that they cannot logically be denied without at
  the same time complete and absolute scepticism resulting from such
  denial&mdash;scepticism wherein vanishes any certainty as to the
  existence both of Mr. Spencer and his critic, and by which it is equally
  impossible to have a thought free from doubt, or to go so far as to
  affirm the existence of that very doubt or of the doubter who doubts
  it.</p>

  <p>It may not be amiss here to protest against the intolerable assumption
  of a certain school, who are continually talking in lofty terms of
  "science," but who actually speak of primary religious conceptions as
  "unscientific," and habitually employ the word "science," when they
  should limit it by the prefix "physical." This is the more amazing as not
  a few of this school adopt the idealist philosophy, and affirm that
  "matter and force" are but names for certain "modes of consciousness." It
  might be expected of them at least to admit that opinions which repose
  <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>[252]</span>on primary and fundamental intuitions, are
  especially and <i>par excellence</i> scientific.</p>

  <p>Such are some of the objections to the Christian conception of God. We
  may now turn to those which are directed against God as the Creator,
  <i>i.e.</i> as the absolute originator of the universe, without the
  employment of any pre-existing means or material. This is again
  considered by Mr. Spencer as a thoroughly illegitimate symbolic
  conception, as much so as the atheistic one&mdash;the difficulty as to a
  <i>self-existent Creator</i> being in his opinion equal to that of a
  <i>self-existent universe</i>. To this it may be replied that both are of
  course equally <i>unimaginable</i>, but that it is not a question of
  facility of conception&mdash;not which is easiest to conceive, but which
  best accounts for, and accords with, psychological facts; namely, with
  the above-mentioned intuitions. It is contended that <i>we have</i> these
  primary intuitions, and that with these the conception of a self-existent
  Creator is perfectly harmonious. On the other hand, the notion of a
  self-existent universe&mdash;that there is no real distinction between
  the finite and the infinite&mdash;that the universe and ourselves are one
  and the same things with the infinite and the self-existent; these
  assertions, in <i>addition to</i> being unimaginable, <i>contradict</i>
  our primary intuitions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin's objections to "Creation" are of quite a different kind,
  and, before entering upon them, it will be well to endeavour clearly to
  understand what we mean by "Creation," in the various senses in which the
  term may be used.</p>

  <p>In the strictest and highest sense "Creation" is the absolute
  origination of anything by God without pre-existing means or material,
  and is a <i>supernatural</i> act.<a name="NtA_257"
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the secondary and lower sense, "Creation" is the formation of
  anything by God <i>derivatively</i>; that is, that the preceding matter
  has been created with the potentiality to evolve from it, <!-- Page 253
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>[253]</span>under suitable
  conditions, all the various forms it subsequently assumes. And this power
  having been conferred by God in the first instance, and those laws and
  powers having been instituted by Him, through the action of which the
  suitable conditions are supplied, He is said in this lower sense to
  create such various subsequent forms. This is the <i>natural</i> action
  of God in the physical world, as distinguished from His direct, or, as it
  may be here called, supernatural action.</p>

  <p>In yet a third sense, the word "Creation" may be more or less
  improperly applied to the construction of any complex formation or state
  by a voluntary self-conscious being who makes use of the powers and laws
  which God has imposed, as when a man is spoken of as the creator of a
  museum, or of "his own fortune," &amp;c. Such action of a created
  conscious intelligence is purely natural, but more than physical, and may
  be conveniently spoken of as hyperphysical.</p>

  <p>We have thus (1) direct or supernatural action; (2) physical action;
  and (3) hyperphysical action&mdash;-the two latter both belonging to the
  order of nature.<a name="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>
  Neither the physical nor the hyperphysical actions, however, exclude the
  idea of the Divine concurrence, and with every consistent theist that
  idea is necessarily included. Dr. Asa Gray has given expression to
  this.<a name="NtA_259" href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> He says,
  "Agreeing that plants and animals were produced by Omnipotent fiat, does
  not exclude the idea of natural order and what we call secondary causes.
  The record of the fiat&mdash;'Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
  yielding seed,' &amp;c., 'let the earth bring forth the living creature
  after his kind'&mdash;seems even to imply them," and leads to the
  conclusion that the various kinds were produced through natural
  agencies.</p>

<p><!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>[254]</span></p>

  <p>Now, much confusion has arisen from not keeping clearly in view this
  distinction between <i>absolute</i> creation and <i>derivative</i>
  creation. With the first, physical science has plainly nothing whatever
  to do, and is impotent to prove or to refute it. The second is also safe
  from any attack on the part of physical science, for it is primarily
  derived from psychical not physical phenomena. The greater part of the
  apparent force possessed by objectors to creation, like Mr. Darwin, lies
  in their treating the assertion of derivative creation as if it was an
  assertion of absolute creation, or at least of supernatural action. Thus,
  he asks whether some of his opponents believe "that at innumerable
  periods in the earth's history, certain elemental atoms have been
  commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues."<a name="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> Certain of Mr. Darwin's objections,
  however, are not physical, but <i>metaphysical</i>, and really attack the
  dogma of secondary or derivative creation, though to some perhaps they
  may appear to be directed against absolute creation only.</p>

  <p>Thus he uses, as an illustration, the conception of a man who builds
  an edifice from fragments of rock at the base of a precipice, by
  selecting for the construction of the various parts of the building the
  pieces which are the most suitable owing to the shape they happen to have
  broken into. Afterwards, alluding to this illustration, he says,<a
  name="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> "The shape of the
  fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may be called accidental,
  but this is not strictly correct, for the shape of each depends on a long
  sequence of events, all obeying natural laws, on the nature of the rock,
  on the lines of stratification or cleavage, on the form of the mountain
  which depends on its upheaval and subsequent denudation, and lastly, on
  the storm and earthquake which threw down the fragments. But in regard to
  the use to which the fragments may be put, their shape may strictly be
  <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>[255]</span>said to be accidental. And here we are led
  to face a great difficulty, in alluding to which I am aware that I am
  travelling beyond my proper province."</p>

  <p>"An omniscient Creator must have foreseen every consequence which
  results from the laws imposed by Him; but can it be reasonably maintained
  that the Creator intentionally ordered, if we use the words in any
  ordinary sense, that certain fragments of rock should assume certain
  shapes, so that the builder might erect his edifice? If the various laws
  which have determined the shape of each fragment were not predetermined
  for the builder's sake, can it with any greater probability be maintained
  that He specially ordained, for the sake of the breeder, each of the
  innumerable variations in our domestic animals and plants&mdash;many of
  these variations being of no service to man, and not beneficial, far more
  often injurious, to the creatures themselves? Did He ordain that the crop
  and tail-feathers of the pigeon should vary, in order that the fancier
  might make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He cause the
  frame and mental qualities of the dog to vary, in order that a breed
  might be formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the
  bull for man's brutal sport? But, if we give up the principle in one
  case&mdash;-if we do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog
  were intentionally guided, in order that the greyhound, for instance,
  that perfect image of symmetry and vigour, might be formed,&mdash;no
  shadow of reason can be assigned for the belief that the variations,
  alike in nature, and the result of the same general laws, which have been
  the groundwork through Natural Selection of the formation of the most
  perfectly adapted animals in the world, man included, were intentionally
  and specially guided. However much we may wish it, we can hardly follow
  Professor Asa Gray in his belief that 'variation has been led along
  certain beneficial lines,' like a stream 'along definite and useful lines
  of irrigation.'"</p>

  <p>"If we assume that each particular variation was from the <!-- Page
  256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[256]</span>beginning
  of all time pre-ordained, the plasticity of the organization, which leads
  to many injurious deviations of structure, as well as that redundant
  power of reproduction which inevitably leads to a struggle for existence,
  and, as a consequence, to the Natural Selection and survival of the
  fittest, must appear to us superfluous laws of nature. On the other hand,
  an omnipotent and omniscient Creator ordains everything and foresees
  everything. Thus we are brought face to face with a difficulty as
  insoluble as is that of freewill and predestination."</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to reply to this remarkable passage, it may be well
  to remind some readers that belief in the existence of God, in His
  primary creation of the universe, and in His derivative creation of all
  kinds of being, inorganic and organic, do not repose upon physical
  phenomena, but, as has been said, on primary intuitions. To deny or
  ridicule any of these beliefs on physical grounds is to commit the
  fallacy of <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>. It is to commit an absurdity
  analogous to that of saying a blind child could not recognize his father
  because he could not <i>see</i> him, forgetting that he could <i>hear</i>
  and <i>feel</i> him. Yet there are some who appear to find it
  unreasonable and absurd that men should regard phenomena in a light not
  furnished by or deducible from the very phenomena themselves, although
  the men so regarding them avow that the light in which they do view them
  comes from quite another source. It is as if a man, A, coming into B's
  room and finding there a butterfly, should insist that B had no right to
  believe that the butterfly had not flown in at the open window, inasmuch
  as there was nothing about the room or insect to lead to any other
  belief; while B can well sustain his right so to believe, he having met
  C, who told him he brought in the chrysalis and, having seen the insect
  emerge, took away the skin.</p>

  <p>By a similarly narrow and incomplete view the assertion that human
  conceptions, such as "the vertebrate idea," &amp;c., are ideas in the
  mind of God, is sometimes ridiculed; as if the assertors <!-- Page 257
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>[257]</span>either on the
  one hand pretended to some prodigious acuteness of mind&mdash;a
  far-reaching genius not possessed by most naturalists&mdash;or, on the
  other hand, as if they detected in the very phenomena furnishing such
  special conception evidences of Divine imaginings. But let the idea of
  God, according to the highest conceptions of Christianity, be once
  accepted, and then it becomes simply a truism to say that the mind of the
  Deity contains all that is <i>good</i> and <i>positive</i> in the mind of
  man, <i>plus</i>, of course, an absolutely inconceivable infinity beyond.
  That thus such human conceptions may, nay must, be asserted to be at the
  same time ideas in the Divine mind also, as every real and separate
  individual that has been, is, or shall be, is present to the same mind.
  Nay, more, that such human conceptions are but faint and obscure
  adumbrations of corresponding ideas which exist in the mind of God in
  perfection and fulness.<a name="NtA_262"
  href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The theist, having arrived at his theistic convictions from quite
  other sources than a consideration of zoological or botanical <!-- Page
  258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>[258]</span>phenomena,
  returns to the consideration of such phenomena and views them in a
  theistic light without of course asserting or implying that such light
  has been derived <i>from them</i>, or that there is an obligation of
  reason so to view them on the part of others who refuse to enter upon or
  to accept those other sources whence have been derived the theistic
  convictions of the theist.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Darwin is not guilty of arguing against metaphysical ideas on
  physical grounds only, for he employs very distinctly metaphysical ones;
  namely, his conceptions of the nature and attributes of the First Cause.
  But what conceptions does he offer us? Nothing but that low
  anthropomorphism which, unfortunately, he so often seems to treat as the
  necessary result of Theism. It is again the dummy, helpless and deformed,
  set up merely for the purpose of being knocked down.</p>

  <p>It must once more be insisted on, that though man is indeed compelled
  to conceive of God in human terms, and to speak of Him by epithets
  objectively false, from their hopeless inadequacy, yet nevertheless the
  Christian thinker declares that inadequacy in the strongest manner, and
  vehemently rejects from his idea of God all terms distinctly implying
  infirmity or limitation.</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. Darwin speaks as if all who believe in the Almighty were
  compelled to accept as really applicable to the Deity conceptions which
  affirm limits and imperfections. Thus he says: "Can it be reasonably
  maintained that the Creator intentionally ordered" "that certain
  fragments of rock should assume certain shapes, so that the builder might
  erect his edifice?"</p>

  <p>Why, surely every theist must maintain that in the first foundation of
  the universe&mdash;the primary and absolute creation&mdash;God saw and
  knew every purpose which every atom and particle of matter should ever
  subserve in all suns and systems, and throughout all coming æons of time.
  It is almost incredible, but nevertheless it seems necessary to think
  that the difficulty thus proposed rests on a sort of notion that amidst
  the boundless profusion of nature there is too much for God to
  superintend; that the number <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>[259]</span>of objects is too great for an infinite
  and <i>omnipresent</i> being to attend singly to each and all in their
  due proportions and needs! In the same way Mr. Darwin asks whether God
  can have ordered the race variations referred to in the passage last
  quoted, for the considerations therein mentioned. To this it may be at
  once replied that even man often has <i>several</i> distinct intentions
  and motives for a <i>single</i> action, and the theist has no difficulty
  in supposing that, out of an infinite number of motives, the motive
  mentioned in each case may have been an exceedingly subordinate one. The
  theist, though properly attributing to God what, for want of a better
  term, he calls "purpose" and "design," yet affirms that the limitations
  of human purposes and motives are by no means applicable to the Divine
  "purposes." Out of many, say a thousand million, reasons for the
  institution of the laws of the physical universe, some few are to a
  certain extent conceivable by us; and amongst these the benefits,
  material and moral, accruing from them to men, and to each individual man
  in every circumstance of his life, play a certain, perhaps a very
  subordinate, part.<a name="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>
  As Baden Powell observes, "How can we <!-- Page 260 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>[260]</span>undertake to affirm,
  amid all the possibilities of things of which we confessedly know so
  little, that a thousand ends and purposes may not be answered, because we
  can trace none, or even imagine none, which seem to our short-sighted
  faculties to be answered in these particular arrangements?"<a
  name="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The objection to the bull-dog's ferocity in connexion with "man's
  brutal sport" opens up the familiar but vast question of the existence of
  evil, a problem the discussion of which would be out of place here.
  Considering, however, the very great stress which is laid in the present
  day on the subject of animal suffering by so many amiable and excellent
  people, one or two remarks on that matter may not be superfluous. To
  those who accept the belief in God, the soul and moral responsibility;
  and recognize the full results of that acceptance&mdash;to such, physical
  suffering and moral evil are simply incommensurable. To them the placing
  of non-moral beings in the same scale with moral agents will be utterly
  unendurable. But even considering physical pain only, all must admit that
  this depends greatly on the mental condition of the sufferer. Only during
  consciousness does it exist, and only in the most highly-organized men
  does it reach its acme. The Author has been assured that lower races of
  men appear less keenly sensitive to physical pain than do more cultivated
  and refined human beings. Thus only in man can there really be any
  intense degree of suffering, because only in him is there that
  intellectual recollection of past moments and that anticipation of future
  ones, which constitute in great part the bitterness of suffering.<a
  name="NtA_265" href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> The momentary pang,
  the present pain, which beasts endure, though real enough, is yet, <!--
  Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page261"></a>[261]</span>doubtless, not to be compared as to its
  intensity with the suffering which is produced in man through his high
  prerogative of self-consciousness.<a name="NtA_266"
  href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As to the "beneficial lines" (of Dr. Asa Gray, before referred to),
  some of the facts noticed in the preceding chapters seem to point very
  decidedly in that direction, but all must admit that the actual existing
  outcome is far more "beneficial" than the reverse. The natural universe
  has resulted in the development of an unmistakable harmony and beauty,
  and in a decided preponderance of good and of happiness over their
  opposites.</p>

  <p>Even if "laws of nature" did appear, on the theistic hypothesis, to be
  "superfluous" (which it is by no means intended here to admit), it would
  be nothing less than puerile to prefer rejecting the hypothesis to
  conceiving that the appearance of superfluity was probably due to human
  ignorance; and this especially might be expected from naturalists to whom
  the interdependence of nature and the harmony and utility of obscure
  phenomena are becoming continually more clear, as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
  structure of orchids to their illustrious expositor.</p>

  <p>Having now cleared the ground somewhat, we may turn to the question
  what bearing Christian dogma has upon evolution, and whether Christians,
  as such, need take up any definite attitude concerning it.</p>

  <p>As has been said, it is plain that physical science and "evolution"
  <i>can</i> have nothing whatever to do with absolute or primary creation.
  The Rev. Baden Powell well expresses this, saying: "Science demonstrates
  incessant past changes, and dimly points to yet earlier links in a more
  vast series of development of material existence; but the idea of a
  <i>beginning</i>, or of <i>creation</i>, in the sense of the original
  operation of the Divine volition to <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>[262]</span>constitute nature and
  matter, is beyond the province of physical philosophy."<a name="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With secondary or derivative creation, physical science is also
  incapable of conflict; for the objections drawn by some writers seemingly
  from physical science, are, as has been already argued, rather
  metaphysical than physical.</p>

  <p>Derivative creation is not a supernatural act, but is simply the
  Divine action by and through natural laws. To recognize such action in
  such laws is a religious mode of regarding phenomena, which a consistent
  theist must necessarily accept, and which an atheistic believer must
  similarly reject. But this conception, if deemed superfluous by any
  naturalist, can never be shown to be <i>false</i> by any investigations
  concerning natural laws, the constant action of which it presupposes.</p>

  <p>The conflict has arisen through a misunderstanding. Some have supposed
  that by "creation" was necessarily meant either primary, that is,
  absolute creation, or, at least, some supernatural action; they have
  therefore opposed the dogma of "creation" in the imagined interest of
  physical science.</p>

  <p>Others have supposed that by "evolution" was necessarily meant a
  denial of Divine action, a negation of the providence of God. They have
  therefore combated the theory of "evolution" in the imagined interest of
  religion.</p>

  <p>It appears plain then that Christian thinkers are perfectly free to
  accept the general evolution theory. But are there any theological
  authorities to justify this view of the matter?</p>

  <p>Now, considering how extremely recent are these biological
  speculations, it might hardly be expected <i>a priori</i> that writers of
  earlier ages should have given expression to doctrines harmonizing in any
  degree with such very modern views,<a name="NtA_268"
  href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> nevertheless <!-- Page 263 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[263]</span>such most certainly is
  the case, and it would be easy to give numerous examples. It will be
  better, however, only to cite <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>[264]</span>one or two authorities of weight. Now,
  perhaps no writer of the earlier Christian ages could be quoted whose
  authority is more generally recognized than that of St. Augustin. The
  same may be said of the mediæval period, for St. Thomas Aquinas; and,
  since the movement of Luther, Suarez may be taken as a writer widely
  venerated as an authority and one whose orthodoxy has never been
  questioned.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind that for a considerable time after even the
  last of these writers no one had disputed the generally received view as
  to the small age of the world or at least of the kinds of animals and
  plants inhabiting it. It becomes therefore much more striking if views
  formed under such a condition of opinion are found to harmonize with
  modern ideas regarding "Creation" and organic life.</p>

  <p>Now St. Augustin insists in a very remarkable manner on the merely
  derivative sense in which God's creation of organic forms is to be
  understood; that is, that God created them by conferring on the material
  world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions. He says in his
  book on Genesis:<a name="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>
  "Terrestria animalia, tanquam ex ultimo elemento mundi ultima;
  nihilominus <i>potentialiter</i>, quorum numeros tempus postea
  visibiliter explicaret."</p>

  <p>Again he says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sicut autem in ipso grano invisibiliter erant omnia simul, quæ per
  tempora in arborem surgerent; ita ipse mundus cogitandus est, cum Deus
  <i>simul omnia creavit</i>, habuisse simul omnia quæ in illo et cum illo
  facta sunt quando factus est dies; non solum c&oelig;lum cum sole et lunâ
  et sideribus ... ; sed etiam illa quæ aqua et terra produxit
  potentialiter atque causaliter, priusquam per temporum moras ita
  exorirentur, quomodo nobis jam nota sunt in eis operibus, quæ Deus usque
  nunc operatur."<a name="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Omnium quippe rerum quæ corporaliter visibiliterque <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[265]</span>nascuntur,
  occulta quædam semina in istis corporeis mundi hujus elementis latent."<a
  name="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

  <p>And again: "Ista quippe originaliter ac primordialiter in quadam
  textura elementorum cuncta jam creata sunt; sed acceptis opportunitatibus
  prodeunt."<a name="NtA_272" href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

  <p>St. Thomas Aquinas, as was said in the first chapter, quotes with
  approval the saying of St. Augustin that in the first institution of
  nature we do not look for <i>Miracles</i>, but for the <i>laws of
  Nature</i>: "In prima institutione naturæ non quæritur miraculum, sed
  quid natura rerum habeat, ut Augustinus dicit."<a name="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Again, he quotes with approval St. Augustin's assertion that the kinds
  were created only derivatively, "<i>potentialiter tantum</i>."<a
  name="NtA_274" href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Also he says, "In prima autem rerum institutione fuit principium
  activum verbum Dei, quod de materia elementari produxit animalia, vel in
  actu vel <i>virtute</i>, secundum Aug. lib. 5 de Gen. ad lit. c. 5."<a
  name="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Speaking of "kinds" (in scholastic phraseology "substantial forms")
  latent in matter, he says: "Quas quidam posuerunt non incipere per
  actionem naturæ sed prius in materia exstitisse, ponentes latitationem
  formarum. Et hoc accidit eis ex ignorantia materiæ, quia nesciebant
  distinguere inter potentiam et actum. Quia enim formæ præexistunt eas
  simpliciter præexistere."<a name="NtA_276"
  href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Also Cornelius à Lapide<a name="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> contends that at least certain
  animals were not absolutely, but only derivatively created, saying of
  them, "Non fuerunt creata formaliter, sed potentialiter."</p>

  <p>As to Suarez, it will be enough to refer to Disp. xv., 2, n. 9, p.
  508, t. i. Edition <i>Vives</i>, Paris; also Nos. 13&mdash;15, and many
  <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>[266]</span>other references to the same effect could
  easily be given, but these may suffice.</p>

  <p>It is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological
  authorities distinctly assert <i>derivative</i> creation, and thus
  harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require.</p>

  <p>It may indeed truly be said with Roger Bacon, "The saints never
  condemned many an opinion which the moderns think ought to be
  condemned."<a name="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The various extracts given show clearly how far "evolution" is from
  any necessary opposition to the most orthodox theology. The same may be
  said of spontaneous generation. The most recent form of it, lately
  advocated by Dr. H. Charlton Bastian,<a name="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> teaches that matter exists in two
  different forms, the crystalline (or statical) and the colloidal (or
  dynamical) conditions. It also teaches that colloidal matter, when
  exposed to certain conditions, presents the phenomena of life, and that
  it can be formed from crystalline matter, and thus that the <i>prima
  materia</i> of which these are diverse forms contains potentially all the
  multitudinous kinds of animal and vegetable existence. This theory
  moreover harmonizes well with the views here advocated, for just as
  crystalline matter builds itself, under suitable conditions, along
  <i>certain definite lines</i>, so analogously colloidal matter has <i>its
  definite lines and directions</i> of development. It is not collected in
  haphazard, accidental aggregations, but evolves according to its proper
  laws and special properties.</p>

  <p>The perfect orthodoxy of these views is unquestionable. Nothing is
  plainer from the venerable writers quoted, as well as <!-- Page 267
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[267]</span>from a mass of
  other authorities, than that "the supernatural" is not to be looked for
  or expected in the sphere of mere nature. For this statement there is a
  general <i>consensus</i> of theological authority.</p>

  <p>The teaching which the Author has received is, that God is indeed
  inscrutable and incomprehensible to us from the infinity of His
  attributes, so that our minds can, as it were, only take in, in a most
  fragmentary and indistinct manner (as through a glass darkly), dim
  conceptions of infinitesimal portions of His inconceivable perfection. In
  this way the partial glimpses obtained by us in different modes differ
  from each other; not that God is anything but the most perfect unity, but
  that apparently conflicting views arise from our inability to apprehend
  Him, except in this imperfect manner, <i>i.e.</i> by successive slight
  approximations along different lines of approach. Sir William Hamilton
  has said,<a name="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> "Nature
  conceals God, and man reveals Him." It is not, according to the teaching
  spoken of, exactly thus; but rather that physical nature reveals to us
  one side, one aspect of the Deity, while the moral and religious worlds
  bring us in contact with another, and at first, to our apprehension, a
  very different one. The difference and discrepancy, however, which is at
  first felt, is soon seen to proceed not from the reason but from a want
  of flexibility in the imagination. This want is far from surprising. Not
  only may a man naturally be expected to be an adept in his own art, but
  at the same time to show an incapacity for a very different mode of
  activity.<a name="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> We rarely
  find an artist who takes much interest <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[268]</span>in jurisprudence, or a
  prizefighter who is an acute metaphysician. Nay, more than this, a
  positive distaste may grow up, which, in the intellectual order, may
  amount to a spontaneous and unreasoning disbelief in that which appears
  to be in opposition to the more familiar concept, and this at all times.
  It is often and truly said, "that past ages were pre-eminently credulous
  as compared with our own, yet the difference is not so much in the amount
  of the credulity, as in the direction which it takes."<a name="NtA_282"
  href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Dr. Newman observes: "Any one study, of whatever kind, exclusively
  pursued, deadens in the mind the interest, nay the perception of any
  other. Thus Cicero says, that Plato and Demosthenes, Aristotle and
  Isocrates, might have respectively excelled in each other's province, but
  that each was absorbed in his own. Specimens of this peculiarity occur
  every day. You can hardly persuade some men to talk about anything but
  their own pursuit; they refer the whole world to their own centre, and
  measure all matters by their own rule, like the fisherman in the drama,
  whose eulogy on his deceased lord was 'he was so fond of fish.'"<a
  name="NtA_283" href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The same author further says:<a name="NtA_284"
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> "When anything, which comes before
  us, is very unlike what we commonly experience, we consider it on that
  account untrue; not because it really shocks our reason as improbable,
  but because it startles our imagination as strange. Now, revelation
  presents to us a perfectly different aspect of the universe from that
  presented by the sciences. The two informations are like the distinct
  subjects represented by the lines of the same drawing, which, accordingly
  <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>[269]</span>as they are read on their concave or
  convex side, exhibit to us now a group of trees with branches and leaves,
  and now human faces." ... "While then reason and revelation are
  consistent in fact, they often are inconsistent in appearance; and this
  seeming discordance acts most keenly on the imagination, and may suddenly
  expose a man to the temptation, and even hurry him on to the commission
  of definite acts of unbelief, in which reason itself really does not come
  into exercise at all."<a name="NtA_285"
  href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus we find in fact just that distinctness between the ideas derived
  from physical science on the one hand and from religion on the other,
  which we might <i>a priori</i> expect if there exists that distinctness
  between the natural and the miraculous which theological authorities lay
  down.</p>

  <p>Assuming, for argument's sake, the truth of Christianity, it evidently
  has not been the intention of its Author to make the evidence for it so
  plain that its rejection would be the mark of intellectual incapacity.
  Conviction is not forced upon men in the way that the knowledge that the
  government of England is constitutional, or that Paris is the capital of
  France, is forced upon all who choose to inquire into those subjects. The
  Christian system is one which puts on the strain, as it were,
  <i>every</i> faculty of man's nature, and the intellect is not (any more
  than we should <i>a priori</i> expect it to be) exempted from taking part
  in the probationary trial. A moral element enters into the acceptance of
  that system.</p>

  <p>And so with natural religion&mdash;with those ideas of the
  supernatural, viz. God, Creation, and Morality, which are anterior to
  revelation and repose upon reason. Here again it evidently has not been
  the intention of the Creator to make the evidence of His existence so
  plain that its non-recognition would be <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[270]</span>the mark of
  intellectual incapacity. Conviction, as to theism, is not forced upon men
  as is the conviction of the existence of the sun at noon-day.<a
  name="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> A moral element enters
  also here, and the analogy there is in this respect between Christianity
  and theism speaks eloquently of their primary derivation from one common
  author.</p>

  <p>Thus we might expect that it would be a vain task to seek anywhere in
  nature for evidence of Divine action, such that no one could sanely deny
  it. God will not allow Himself to be caught at the bottom of any man's
  crucible, or yield Himself to the experiments of gross-minded and
  irreverent inquirers. The natural, like the supernatural, revelation
  appeals to <i>the whole</i> of man's mental nature and not to the
  <i>reason alone</i>.<a name="NtA_287"
  href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

  <p>None, therefore, need feel disappointed that evidence of the direct
  action of the first cause in merely natural phenomena ever eludes our
  grasp; for assuredly those same phenomena will ever remain fundamentally
  inexplicable by physical science alone.</p>

  <p>There being then nothing in either authority or reason which makes
  "evolution" repugnant to Christianity, is there anything in the Christian
  doctrine of "Creation" which is repugnant to the theory of
  "evolution"?</p>

  <p>Enough has been said as to the distinction between absolute and
  derivative "creation." It remains to consider the successive "evolution"
  (Darwinian and other) of "specific forms," in a theological light.</p>

  <p>As to what "evolution" is, we cannot of course hope to explain it
  completely, but it may be enough to define it as the manifestation to the
  intellect, by means of sensible impressions, of some ideal entity (power,
  principle, nature, or activity) <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>[271]</span>which before that manifestation was in a
  latent, unrealized, and merely "potential" state&mdash;a state that is
  capable of becoming realized, actual, or manifest, the requisite
  conditions being supplied.</p>

  <p>"Specific forms," kinds or species, are (as was said in the
  introductory chapter) "peculiar congeries of characters or attributes,
  innate powers and qualities, and a certain nature realized in
  individuals."</p>

  <p>Thus, then, the "evolution of specific forms" means the actual
  manifestation of special powers, or natures, which before were latent, in
  such a successive manner that there is in some way a genetic relation
  between posterior manifestations and those which preceded them.</p>

  <p>On the special Darwinian hypothesis the manifestation of these forms
  is determined simply by the survival of the fittest of many indefinite
  variations.</p>

  <p>On the hypothesis here advocated the manifestation is controlled and
  helped by such survival, but depends on some unknown internal law or laws
  which determine variation at special times and in special directions.</p>

  <p>Professor Agassiz objects to the evolution theory, on the ground that
  "species, genera, families, &amp;c., exist as thoughts, individuals as
  facts,"<a name="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> and he
  offers the dilemma, "If species do not exist at all, as the supporters of
  the transmutation theory maintain, how can they vary? and if individuals
  alone exist, how can the differences which may be observed among them
  prove the variability of species?"</p>

  <p>But the supporter of "evolution" need only maintain that the several
  "kinds" become manifested gradually by slight differences among the
  various individual embodiments of one specific idea. He might reply to
  the dilemma by saying, species do not exist <i>as species</i> in the
  sense in which they are said to vary (variation applying only to the
  concrete embodiments of <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page272"></a>[272]</span>the specific idea), and the evolution of
  species is demonstrated not by individuals <i>as individuals</i>, but as
  embodiments of different specific ideas.</p>

  <p>Some persons seem to object to the term "creation" being applied to
  evolution, because evolution is an "exceedingly slow and gradual
  process." Now even if it were demonstrated that such is really the case,
  it may be asked, what is "slow and gradual"? The terms are simply
  relative, and the evolution of a specific form in ten thousand years
  would be instantaneous to a being whose days were as hundreds of millions
  of years.</p>

  <p>There are others again who are inclined absolutely to deny the
  existence of species altogether, on the ground that their evolution is so
  gradual that if we could see all the stages it would be impossible to say
  <i>when</i> the manifestation of the old specific form ceased and that of
  the new one began. But surely it is no approach to a reason against the
  existence of a thing that we cannot determine the exact moment of its
  first manifestation. When watching "dissolving views," who can tell,
  whilst closely observing the gradual changes, exactly at what moment a
  new picture, say St. Mark's, Venice, can be said to have commenced its
  manifestation, or have begun to dominate a preceding representation of
  "Dotheboys' Hall"? That, however, is no reason for denying the complete
  difference between the two pictures and the ideas they respectively
  embody.</p>

  <p>The notion of a special nature, a peculiar innate power and
  activity&mdash;what the scholastics called a "substantial
  form"&mdash;will be distasteful to many. The objection to the notion
  seems, however, to be a futile one, for it is absolutely impossible to
  altogether avoid such a conception and such an assumption. If we refuse
  it to the individuals which embody the species, we must admit it as
  regards their component parts&mdash;nay, even if we accept the hypothesis
  of pangenesis, we are nevertheless compelled to attribute to each gemmule
  that peculiar power of reproducing its own nature (its own "substantial
  form"), with its <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>[273]</span>special activity, and that remarkable
  power of annexing itself to certain other well-defined gemmules whose
  nature it is also to plant themselves in a certain definite vicinity. So
  that in each individual, instead of one such peculiar power and activity
  dominating and controlling all the parts, you have an infinity of
  separate powers and activities limited to the several minute component
  gemmules.</p>

  <p>It is possible that in some minds, the notion may lurk that such
  powers are simpler and easier to understand, because the bodies they
  affect are so minute! This absurdity hardly bears stating. We can easily
  conceive a being so small, that a gemmule would be to it as large as St.
  Paul's would be to us.</p>

  <p>Admitting then the existence of species, and of their successive
  evolution, is there anything in these ideas hostile to Christian
  belief?</p>

  <p>Writers such as Vogt and Buchner will of course contend that there is;
  but naturalists, generally, assume that God acts in and by the various
  laws of nature. And this is equivalent to admitting the doctrine of
  "derivative creation." With very few exceptions, none deny such Divine
  concurrence. Even "design" and "purpose" are recognized as quite
  compatible with evolution, and even with the special "nebular" and
  Darwinian forms of it. Professor Huxley well says,<a name="NtA_289"
  href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> "It is necessary to remark that there
  is a wider teleology, which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution,
  but is actually based upon the fundamental proposition of evolution." ...
  "The teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not necessarily
  mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the more purely a mechanist the
  speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular
  arrangement, of which all the phenomena of the universe are the
  consequences; and the more completely thereby is he at the mercy of the
  teleologist, who can always defy him to <!-- Page 274 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>[274]</span>disprove that this
  primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena
  of the universe."<a name="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Professor Owen says, that natural evolution, through secondary causes,
  "by means of slow physical and organic operations through long ages, is
  not the less clearly recognizable as the act of all adaptive mind,
  because we have abandoned the old error of supposing it to be the
  result<a name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> of a primary,
  direct, and sudden act of creational construction." ... "The succession
  of species by continuously operating law, is not necessarily a 'blind
  operation.' Such law, however discerned in the properties and successions
  of natural objects, intimates, nevertheless, a preconceived progress.
  Organisms may be evolved in orderly succession, stage after stage,
  towards a foreseen goal, and the broad features of the course may still
  show the unmistakable impress of Divine volition."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace<a name="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a>
  declares that the opponents of evolution present a less elevated view of
  the Almighty. He says: "Why should we suppose the machine too complicated
  to have been designed by the Creator so complete that it would
  necessarily work out harmonious results? The theory of 'continual
  interference' is a limitation of the Creator's power. It assumes that He
  could not work by pure law in the organic, as He has done in the
  inorganic world." Thus, then, there is not only no necessary antagonism
  between the general theory of "evolution" and a Divine action, but the
  compatibility between the two is recognized by naturalists who cannot be
  suspected of any strong theological bias.</p>

<p><!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span></p>

  <p>The very same may be said as to the special Darwinian form of the
  theory of evolution.</p>

  <p>It is true Mr. Darwin writes sometimes as if he thought that his
  theory militated against even <i>derivative creation</i>.<a
  name="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> This, however, there
  is no doubt, was not really meant; and indeed, in the passage before
  quoted and criticised, the possibility of the Divine ordination of each
  variation is spoken of as a tenable view. He says ("Origin of Species,"
  p. 569), "I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should
  shock the religious feelings of anyone;" and he speaks of life "having
  been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one,"
  which is <i>more</i> than the dogma of creation actually requires. We
  find then that no <i>in</i>compatibility is asserted (by any scientific
  writers worthy of mention) between "evolution" and the co-operation of
  the Divine will; while the same "evolution" has been shown to be
  thoroughly acceptable to the most orthodox theologians who repudiate the
  intrusion of the supernatural into the domain of nature. A more complete
  harmony could scarcely be desired.</p>

  <p>But if we may never hope to find, in physical nature, evidence of
  supernatural action, what sort of action might we expect to find there,
  looking at it from a theistic point of view? Surely an action the results
  of which harmonize with man's reason,<a name="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> which <!-- Page 276 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>[276]</span>is orderly, which
  disaccords with the action of blind chance and with the "fortuitous
  concourse of atoms" of Democritus; but at the same time an action which,
  as to its modes, ever, in parts, and in ultimate analysis, eludes our
  grasp, and the modes of which are different from those by which we should
  have attempted to accomplish such ends.</p>

  <p>Now, this is just what we <i>do</i> find. The harmony, the beauty, and
  the order of the physical universe are the themes of continual panegyrics
  on the part of naturalists, and Mr. Darwin, as the Duke of Argyll
  remarks,<a name="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> "exhausts
  every form of words and of illustration by which intention or mental
  purpose can be described"<a name="NtA_296"
  href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> when speaking of the wonderfully
  complex adjustments to secure the fertilization of orchids. Also, we find
  co-existing with this harmony a mode of proceeding so different from that
  of man as (the direct supernatural action eluding us) to form a
  stumbling-block to many in the way of their recognition of Divine action
  at all: although nothing can be more inconsistent than to speak of the
  first cause as utterly inscrutable and incomprehensible, and at the same
  time to expect to find traces of a mode of action exactly similar to our
  own. It is surely enough if the results harmonize on the whole and
  preponderatingly with the rational, moral, and æsthetic instincts of
  man.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. J. Murphy<a name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a>
  has brought strongly forward the evidence of "intelligence" throughout
  organic nature. He believes "that there is something in organic progress
  which mere Natural Selection among spontaneous variations will not
  account for," and that "this something is that organizing intelligence
  which guides the action of the inorganic forces, and forms structures
  which neither Natural Selection nor any other unintelligent agency could
  form."</p>

<p><!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[277]</span></p>

  <p>This intelligence, however, Mr. Murphy considers may be unconscious, a
  conception which it is exceedingly difficult to understand, and which to
  many minds appears to be little less than a contradiction in terms; the
  very first condition of an intelligence being that, if it knows anything,
  it should at least know its own existence.</p>

  <p>Surely the evidence from physical facts agrees well with the
  overruling, concurrent action of God in the order of nature; which is no
  miraculous action, but the operation of laws which owe their foundation,
  institution, and maintenance to an omniscient Creator of whose
  intelligence our own is a feeble adumbration, inasmuch as it is created
  in the "image and likeness" of its Maker.</p>

  <p>This leads to the final consideration, a difficulty by no means to be
  passed over in silence, namely the <span class="sc">Origin of Man</span>.
  To the general theory of Evolution, and to the special Darwinian form of
  it, no exception, it has been shown, need be taken on the ground of
  orthodoxy. But in saying this, it has not been meant to include the soul
  of man.</p>

  <p>It is a generally received doctrine that the soul of every individual
  man is absolutely created in the strict and primary sense of the word,
  that it is produced by a direct or supernatural<a name="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> act, and, of course, that by such an
  act the soul of the first man was similarly created. It is therefore
  important to inquire whether "evolution" conflicts with this
  doctrine.</p>

  <p>Now the two beliefs are in fact perfectly compatible, and that either
  on the hypothesis&mdash;1. That man's body was created in a manner
  different in kind from that by which the bodies of other animals were
  created; or 2. That it was created in a similar manner to theirs.</p>

  <p>One of the authors of the Darwinian theory, indeed, contends <!-- Page
  278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>[278]</span>that even
  as regards man's body, an action took place different from that by which
  brute forms were evolved. Mr. Wallace<a name="NtA_299"
  href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> considers that "Natural Selection"
  alone could not have produced so large a brain in the savage, in
  possessing which he is furnished with an organ beyond his needs. Also
  that it could not have produced that peculiar distribution of hair,
  especially the nakedness of the back, which is common to all races of
  men, nor the peculiar construction of the feet and hands. He says,<a
  name="NtA_300" href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> after speaking of the
  prehensile foot, common without a single exception to all the apes and
  lemurs, "It is difficult to see why the prehensile power should have been
  taken away" by the mere operation of Natural Selection. "It must
  certainly have been useful in climbing, and the case of the baboons shows
  that it is quite compatible with terrestrial locomotion. It may not be
  compatible with perfectly easy erect locomotion; but, then, how can we
  conceive that early man, <i>as an animal</i>, gained anything by purely
  erect locomotion? Again, the hand of man contains latent capacities and
  powers which are unused by savages, and must have been even less used by
  palæolithic man and his still ruder predecessors. It has all the
  appearance of an organ prepared for the use of civilized man, and one
  which was required to render civilization possible." Again speaking of
  the "wonderful power, range, flexibility, and sweetness of the musical
  sounds producible by the human larynx," he adds, "The habits of savages
  give no indication of how this faculty could have been developed by
  Natural Selection; because it is never required or used by them. The
  singing of savages is a more or less monotonous howling, and the females
  seldom sing at all. Savages certainly never choose their wives for fine
  voices, but for rude health, and strength and physical beauty. Sexual
  selection could not therefore have developed this wonderful power, which
  only comes into play among civilized people. It seems as if the organ had
  been prepared in anticipation of the future <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>[279]</span>progress of man, since
  it contains latent capacities which are useless to him in his earlier
  condition. The delicate correlations of structure that give it such
  marvellous powers, could not therefore have been acquired by means of
  Natural Selection."</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
      <a href="images/295.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/295.png"
      alt="Fibres of Corti." title="Fibres of Corti." /></a>
    FIBRES OF CORTI.
  </div>
  <p>To this may be added the no less wonderful faculty in the ear of
  appreciating delicate musical tones, and the harmony of chords.</p>

  <p>It matters not what part of the organ subserves this function, but it
  has been supposed that it is ministered to by the fibres <i>of
  Corti</i>.<a name="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> Now it
  can hardly be contended that the preservation of any race of men in the
  struggle for life could have depended on such an extreme delicacy and
  refinement of the internal ear,<a name="NtA_302"
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a>&mdash;a perfection only fully
  exercised in the enjoyment and appreciation of the most exquisite musical
  performances. Here, surely, we have an instance of an organ preformed,
  ready beforehand for such action as could never by itself have been the
  cause of its development,&mdash;the action having only been subsequent,
  not anterior. The Author is not aware what may be the minute structure of
  the internal ear in the highest apes, but if (as from analogy is
  probable) it is much as in man, then <i>a fortiori</i> we have an
  instance of <i>anticipatory</i> development of a most <!-- Page 280
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>[280]</span>marked and
  unmistakable kind. And this is not all. There is no reason to suppose
  that any animal besides man appreciates musical <i>harmony</i>. It is
  certain that no other one <i>produces</i> it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace also urges objections drawn from the origin of some of
  man's mental faculties, such as "the capacity to form ideal conceptions
  of space and time, of eternity and infinity&mdash;the capacity for
  intense artistic feelings of pleasure, in form, colour and
  composition&mdash;and for those abstract notions of form and number which
  render geometry and arithmetic possible," also from the origin of the
  moral sense.<a name="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The validity of these objections is fully conceded by the Author of
  this book, but he would push it much further, and contend (as has been
  now repeatedly said), that another law, or other laws, than "Natural
  Selection" have determined the evolution of <i>all</i> organic forms, and
  of inorganic forms also. And it must be contended that Mr. Wallace, in
  order to be quite self-consistent, should arrive at the very same
  conclusion, inasmuch as he is inclined to trace all phenomena to the
  action of superhuman <span class="scac">WILL</span>. He says:<a
  name="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> "If therefore we have
  traced one force, however minute, to an origin in our own <span
  class="scac">WILL</span>, while we have no knowledge of any other primary
  cause of force, it does not seem an improbable conclusion that all force
  may be will-force; and thus, that the whole universe is not merely
  dependent on, but actually <i>is</i>, the <span class="scac">WILL</span>
  of higher intelligences, or of one Supreme Intelligence."</p>

  <p>If there is really evidence, as Mr. Wallace believes, of the action of
  an overruling intelligence in the evolution of the "human form divine;"
  if we may go so far as this, then surely an analogous action may well be
  traced in the production of the horse, the camel, or the dog, so largely
  identified with human wants and requirements. And if from other than
  physical considerations we may believe that such action, though
  undemonstrable, has been and is; then (reflecting on sensible phenomena
  <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>[281]</span>the theistic light derived from psychical
  facts) we may, in the language of Mr. Wallace, "see indications of that
  power in facts which, by themselves, would not serve to prove its
  existence."<a name="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Murphy, as has been said before, finds it necessary to accept the
  wide-spread action of "intelligence" as the agent by which <i>all</i>
  organic forms have been called forth from the inorganic. But all science
  tends to unity, and this tendency makes it reasonable to extend to all
  physical existences a mode of formation which we may have evidence for in
  any <i>one</i> of them. It therefore makes it reasonable to extend, if
  possible, the very same agency which we find operating in the field of
  biology, also to the inorganic world. If on the grounds brought forward
  the action of intelligence may be affirmed in the production of man's
  bodily structure, it becomes probable <i>a priori</i> that it may also be
  predicated of the formative action by which has been produced the animals
  which minister to him, and all organic life whatsoever. Nay more, it is
  then congruous to expect analogous action in the development of
  crystalline and colloidal structures, and in that of all chemical
  compositions, in geological evolutions, and the formation not only of
  this earth, but of the solar system and whole sidereal universe.</p>

  <p>If such really be the direction in which physical science,
  philosophically considered, points; if intelligence may thus be seen to
  preside over the evolution of each system of worlds and the unfolding of
  every blade of grass&mdash;this grand result harmonizes indeed with the
  teachings of faith that God acts and concurs, in the natural order, with
  those laws of the material universe which were not only instituted by His
  will, but are sustained by His concurrence; and we are thus enabled to
  discern in the natural order, however darkly, the Divine Author of
  nature&mdash;Him in whom "we live, and move, and have our being."</p>

  <p>But if this view is accepted, then it is no longer absolutely <!--
  Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>[282]</span>necessary to suppose that any action
  different in kind took place in the production of man's body, from that
  which took place in the production of the bodies of other animals, and of
  the whole material universe.</p>

  <p>Of course, if it <i>can</i> be demonstrated that that difference which
  Mr. Wallace asserts really exists, it is plain that we then have to do
  with facts not only harmonizing with religion, but, as it were, preaching
  and proclaiming it.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, necessary for Christianity that any such view
  should prevail. Man, according to the old scholastic definition, is "a
  rational animal" (<i>animal rationale</i>), and his animality is distinct
  in nature from his rationality, though inseparably joined, during life,
  in one common personality. This animal body must have had a different
  source from that of the spiritual soul which informs it, from the
  distinctness of the two orders to which those two existences severally
  belong.</p>

  <p>Scripture seems plainly to indicate this when it says that "God made
  man from the dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
  of life." This is a plain and direct statement that man's <i>body</i> was
  <i>not</i> created in the primary and absolute sense of the word, but was
  evolved from pre-existing material (symbolized by the term "dust of the
  earth"), and was therefore only <i>derivatively created</i>, i.e. by the
  operation of secondary laws. His <i>soul</i>, on the other hand, was
  created in quite a different way, not by any pre-existing means, external
  to God himself, but by the direct action of the Almighty, symbolized by
  the term "breathing:" the very form adopted by Christ, when conferring
  the <i>supernatural</i> powers and graces of the Christian dispensation,
  and a form still daily used in the rites and ceremonies of the
  Church.</p>

  <p>That the first man should have had this double origin agrees with what
  we now experience. For supposing each human soul to be directly and
  immediately created, yet each human body is evolved by the ordinary
  operation of natural physical laws. <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[283]</span></p>

  <p>Professor Flower in his Introductory Lecture<a name="NtA_306"
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> (p. 20) to his course of Hunterian
  Lectures for 1870 well observes: "Whatever man's place may be, either
  <i>in</i> or <i>out</i> of nature, whatever hopes, or fears or feelings
  about himself or his race he may have, we all of us admit that these are
  quite uninfluenced by our knowledge of the fact that each individual man
  comes into the world by the ordinary processes of generation, according
  to the same laws which apply to the development of all organic beings
  whatever, that every part of him which can come under the scrutiny of the
  anatomist or naturalist, has been evolved according to these regular laws
  from a simple minute ovum, indistinguishable to our senses from that of
  any of the inferior animals. If this be so&mdash;if man is what he is,
  notwithstanding the corporeal mode of origin of the individual man, so he
  will assuredly be neither less nor more than man, whatever may be shown
  regarding the corporeal origin of the whole race, whether this was from
  the dust of the earth, or by the modification of some pre-existing animal
  form."</p>

  <p>Man is indeed compound, in him two distinct orders of being impinge
  and mingle; and with this an origin from two concurrent modes of action
  is congruous, and might be expected <i>a priori</i>. At the same time as
  the "soul" is "the form of the body," the former might be expected to
  modify the latter into a structure of harmony and beauty standing alone
  in the organic world of nature. Also that, with the full perfection and
  beauty of that soul, attained by the concurrent action of "Nature" and
  "Grace," a character would be formed like nothing else which is visible
  in this world, and having a mode of action different, inasmuch as
  complementary to all inferior modes of action.</p>

  <p>Something of this is evident even to those who approach the subject
  from the point of view of physical science only. Thus Mr. Wallace
  observes,<a name="NtA_307" href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> that on
  his view man is to be placed <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>[284]</span>"apart, as not only the head and
  culminating point of the grand series of organic nature, but as in some
  degree <i>a new and distinct order of being</i>.<a name="NtA_308"
  href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> From those infinitely remote ages
  when the first rudiments of organic life appeared upon the earth, every
  plant and every animal has been subject to one great law of physical
  change. As the earth has gone through its grand cycles of geological,
  climatal, and organic progress, every form of life has been subject to
  its irresistible action, and has been continually but imperceptibly
  moulded into such new shapes as would preserve their harmony with the
  ever-changing universe. No living thing could escape this law of its
  being; none (except, perhaps, the simplest and most rudimentary
  organisms) could remain unchanged and live amid the universal change
  around it."</p>

  <p>"At length, however, there came into existence a being in whom that
  subtle force we term <i>mind</i>, became of greater importance than his
  mere bodily structure. Though with a naked and unprotected body,
  <i>this</i> gave him clothing against the varying inclemencies of the
  seasons. Though unable to compete with the deer in swiftness, or with the
  wild bull in strength, <i>this</i> gave him weapons with which to capture
  or overcome both. Though less capable than most other animals of living
  on the herbs and the fruits that unaided nature supplies, this wonderful
  faculty taught him to govern and direct nature to his own benefit, and
  make her produce food for him when and where he pleased. From the moment
  when the first skin was used as a covering; when the first rude spear was
  formed to assist in the chase; when fire was first used to cook his food;
  when the first seed was sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was
  effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of the
  earth's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no
  longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe, a being
  who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to
  control and regulate her action, and could keep <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[285]</span>himself in harmony with
  her, not by a change in body, but by an advance in mind."</p>

  <p>"On this view of his special attributes, we may admit 'that he is
  indeed a being apart.' Man has not only escaped 'Natural Selection'
  himself, but he is actually able to take away some of that power from
  nature which before his appearance she universally exercised. We can
  anticipate the time when the earth will produce only cultivated plants
  and domestic animals; when man's selection shall have supplanted 'Natural
  Selection;' and when the ocean will be the only domain in which that
  power can be exerted."</p>

  <p>Baden Powell<a name="NtA_309" href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a>
  observes on this subject: "The relation of the animal man to the
  intellectual, moral, and spiritual man, resembles that of a crystal
  slumbering in its native quarry to the same crystal mounted in the
  polarizing apparatus of the philosopher. The difference is not in
  physical nature, but in investing that nature with a new and higher
  application. Its continuity with the material world remains the same, but
  a new relation is developed in it, and it claims kindred with ethereal
  matter and with celestial light."</p>

  <p>This well expresses the distinction between the merely physical and
  the hyperphysical natures of man, and the subsumption of the former into
  the latter which dominates it.</p>

  <p>The same author in speaking of man's moral and spiritual nature
  says,<a name="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> "The assertion
  in its very nature and essence refers wholly to a <span
  class="scac">DIFFERENT ORDER OF THINGS</span>, apart from and
  transcending any material ideas whatsoever." Again<a name="NtA_311"
  href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> he adds, "In proportion as man's
  <i>moral</i> superiority is held to consist in attributes <i>not</i> of a
  <i>material</i> or corporeal kind or origin, it can signify little how
  his <i>physical</i> nature may have originated."</p>

  <p>Now physical science, as such, has nothing to do with the soul of man
  which is hyperphysical. That such an entity exists, <!-- Page 286
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>[286]</span>that the
  correlated physical forces go through their Protean transformations, have
  their persistent ebb and flow outside of the world of <span
  class="scac">WILL</span> and <span class="scac">SELF-CONSCIOUS MORAL
  BEING</span>, are propositions the proofs of which have no place in this
  work. This at least may however be confidently affirmed, that no reach of
  physical science in any coming century will ever approach to a
  demonstration that countless modes of being, as different from each other
  as are the force of gravitation and conscious maternal love, may not
  co-exist. Two such modes are made known to us by our natural faculties
  only: the physical, which includes the first of these examples; the
  hyperphysical, which embraces the other. For those who accept revelation,
  a third and a distinct mode of being and of action is also made known,
  namely, the direct and immediate or, in the sense here given to the term,
  the supernatural. An analogous relationship runs through and connects all
  these modes of being and of action. The higher mode in each case employs
  and makes use of the lower, the action of which it occasionally suspends
  or alters, as gravity is suspended by electro-magnetic action, or the
  living energy of an organic being restrains the inter-actions of the
  chemical affinities belonging to its various constituents.</p>

  <p>Thus conscious will controls and directs the exercise of the vital
  functions according to desire, and moral consciousness tends to control
  desire in obedience to higher dictates.<a name="NtA_312"
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> The action of <!-- Page 287 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>[287]</span>living organisms
  depends upon and subsumes the laws of inorganic matter. Similarly the
  actions of animal life depend upon and subsume the laws of organic
  matter. In the same way the actions of a self-conscious moral agent, such
  as man, depend upon and subsume the laws of animal life. When a part or
  the whole series of these natural actions is altered or suspended by the
  intervention of action of a still higher order, we have then a
  "miracle."</p>

  <p>In this way we find a perfect harmony in the double nature of man, his
  rationality making use of and subsuming his animality; his soul arising
  from direct and immediate creation, and his body being formed at first
  (as now in each separate individual) by derivative or secondary creation,
  through natural laws. By such secondary creation, <i>i.e.</i> by natural
  laws, for the most part as yet unknown but controlled by "Natural
  Selection," all the various kinds of animals and plants have been
  manifested on this planet. That Divine action has concurred and concurs
  in these laws we know by deductions from our primary intuitions; and
  physical science, if unable to demonstrate such action, is at least as
  impotent to disprove it. Disjoined from these deductions, the phenomena
  of the universe present an aspect devoid of all that appeals to the
  loftiest aspirations of man, that which stimulates his efforts after
  goodness, and presents consolations for unavoidable shortcomings.
  Conjoined with these same deductions, all the harmony of physical nature
  and the constancy of its laws are preserved unimpaired, while the reason,
  the conscience, and the æsthetic instincts are alike gratified. We have
  thus a true reconciliation of science and religion, in which each gains
  and neither loses, one being complementary to the other.</p>

  <p>Some apology is due to the reader for certain observations and
  arguments which have been here advanced, and which have little in the
  shape of novelty to recommend them. But after all, novelty can hardly be
  predicated of the views here criticised <!-- Page 288 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>[288]</span>and opposed. Some of
  these seem almost a return to the "fortuitous concourse of atoms" of
  Democritus, and even the very theory of "Natural Selection"
  itself&mdash;a "survival of the fittest"&mdash;was in part thought out
  not hundreds but <i>thousands</i> of years ago. Opponents of Aristotle
  maintained that by the accidental occurrence of combinations, organisms
  have been preserved and perpetuated such as final causes, did they exist,
  would have brought about, disadvantageous combinations or variations
  being speedily exterminated. "For when the very same combinations
  happened to be produced which the law of final causes would have called
  into being, those combinations which proved to be advantageous to the
  organism were preserved; while those which were not advantageous
  perished, and still perished like the minotaurs and sphinxes of
  Empedocles."<a name="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In conclusion, the Author ventures to hope that this treatise may not
  be deemed useless, but have contributed, however slightly, towards
  clearing the way for peace and conciliation and for a more ready
  perception, of the harmony which exists between those deductions from our
  primary intuitions before alluded to, and the teachings of physical
  science, as far, that is, as concerns the evolution of organic
  forms&mdash;<i>the genesis of species</i>.</p>

  <p>The aim has been to support the doctrine that these species have been
  evolved by ordinary <i>natural laws</i> (for the most part unknown)
  controlled by the <i>subordinate</i> action of "Natural Selection," and
  at the same time to remind some that there is and can be absolutely
  nothing in physical science which forbids them to regard those natural
  laws as acting with the Divine concurrence and in obedience to a creative
  fiat originally imposed on the primeval Cosmos, "in the beginning," by
  its Creator, its Upholder, and its Lord.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> In the last edition of the
  "Origin of Species" (1869) Mr. Darwin himself admits that "Natural
  Selection" has not been the exclusive means of modification, though he
  still contends it has been the most important one.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> See Mr. Wallace's recent work,
  entitled "Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection," where, at p.
  302, it is very well and shortly stated.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> "Natural Selection" is happily so
  termed by Mr. Herbert Spencer in his "Principles of Biology."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> Biology is the science of life.
  It contains zoology, or the science of animals, and botany, or that of
  plants.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> For very interesting examples,
  see Mr. Wallace's "Malay Archipelago."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> See Müller's work, "Für Darwin,"
  lately translated into English by Mr. Dallas. Mr. Wallace also predicts
  the discovery, in Madagascar, of a hawk-moth with an enormously long
  proboscis, and he does this on account of the discovery there of an
  orchid with a nectary from ten to fourteen inches in length. See
  <i>Quarterly Journal of Science</i>, October 1867, and "Natural
  Selection," p. 275.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> "Pangenesis" is the name of
  the new theory proposed by Mr. Darwin, in order to account for various
  obscure physiological facts, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as the occasional
  reproduction, by individuals, of parts which they have lost; the
  appearance in offspring of parental, and sometimes of remote ancestral,
  characters, &amp;c. It accounts for these phenomena by supposing that
  every creature possesses countless indefinitely-minute organic atoms,
  termed "gemmules," which atoms are supposed to be generated in every part
  of every organ, to be in constant circulation about the body, and to have
  the power of reproduction. Moreover, atoms from every part are supposed
  to be stored in the generative products.</p>

  a spinal column, commonly known as the "backbone." Such animals are
  ourselves, together with all beasts, birds, reptiles, frogs, toads, and
  efts, and also fishes.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> It is hardly necessary to
  observe that these "sea-snakes" have no relation to the often-talked-of
  "sea-serpent." They are small, venomous reptiles, which abound in the
  Indian seas.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_38" href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> Mr. A. D. Bartlett, of the
  Zoological Society, informs me that at these periods female apes admit
  with perfect readiness the access of any males of different species. To
  be sure this is in confinement; but the fact is, I think, quite
  conclusive against any such sexual selection in a state of nature as
  would account for the local coloration referred to.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_39" href="#NtA_39">[39]</a> Mr. Darwin, in the last
  (fifth) edition of "Natural Selection," 1869, p. 102, admits that all
  sexual differences are not to be attributed to the agency of sexual
  selection, mentioning the wattle of carrier pigeons, tuft of turkey-cock,
  &amp;c. These characters, however, seem less inexplicable by sexual
  selection than those given in the text.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> I am again indebted to the
  kindness of Mr. A. D. Bartlett, amongst others. That gentleman informs me
  that, so far from any mental emotion being produced in rabbits by the
  presence and movements of snakes, that he has actually seen a male and
  female rabbit satisfy the sexual instinct in that presence, a rabbit
  being seized by a snake when <i>in coitu</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> The attempt has been made to
  explain these facts as owing to "manner and symmetry of growth, and to
  colour being incidental on the chemical nature of the constituents of the
  shell." But surely beauty depends on some such matters in <i>all</i>
  cases!</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> It has been suggested in
  opposition to what is here said, that there is no real resemblance, but
  that the likeness is "<i>fanciful!</i>" The denial, however, of the fact
  of a resemblance which has struck so many observers, reminds one of the
  French philosopher's estimate of facts hostile to his theory&mdash;"Tant

  are the lower kinds of the order, and differ much from the apes. They
  have their head-quarters in the Island of Madagascar. The aye-aye is a
  lemur, but it differs singularly from all its congeners, and still more
  from all apes. In its dentition it strongly approximates to the rodent
  (rat, squirrel, and guinea-pig) order, as it has two cutting teeth above,
  and two below, growing from permanent pulps, and in the adult condition
  has no canines.</p>

  superfluous lament over the unfortunate organization of the sloth has
  been shown, by the increase of our knowledge, to have been uncalled for
  and absurd, so other supposed instances of non-adaptation will, no doubt,
  similarly disappear. Mr. Darwin, in his "Origin of Species," 5th edition,
  p. 220, speaks of a woodpecker (<i>Colaptes campestris</i>) as having an
  organization quite at variance with its habits, and as never climbing a
  tree, though possessed of the special arboreal structure of other
  woodpeckers. It now appears, however, from the observations of Mr. W. H.
  Hudson, C.M.Z.S., that its habits are in harmony with its structure. See
  Mr. Hudson's third letter to the Zoological Society, published in the
  Proceedings of that Society for March 24, 1870, p. 159.</p>

  relative disability may be read two ways. A disqualification in the
  nature of thought for knowing <i>x</i> is, from the other side, a
  disqualification in the nature of <i>x</i> from being known. To say then
  that the First Cause is wholly removed from our apprehension is not
  simply a disclaimer of faculty on our part: it is a charge of inability
  against the First Cause too. The dictum about it is this: 'It is a Being
  that may exist out of knowledge, but that is precluded from entering
  within the sphere of knowledge.' We are told in one breath that this
  Being must be in every sense 'perfect, complete, total&mdash;including in
  itself all power, and transcending all law' (p. 38); and in another that
  this perfect and omnipotent One is totally incapable of revealing any one
  of an infinite store of attributes. Need we point out the contradictions
  which this position involves? If you abide by it, you deny the Absolute
  and Infinite in the very act of affirming it, for, in debarring the First
  Cause from self-revelation, you impose a limit on its nature. And in the
  very act of declaring the First Cause incognizable, you do not permit it
  to remain unknown. For that only is unknown, of which you can neither
  affirm nor deny any predicate; here you deny the power of self-disclosure
  to the 'Absolute,' of which therefore something is known;&mdash;viz.,
  that nothing can be known!"</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_262" href="#NtA_262">[262]</a> The Rev. Baden Powell says,
  "All sciences approach perfection as they approach to a unity of first
  principles,&mdash;in all cases recurring to or tending towards certain
  high elementary conceptions which are the representatives of the unity of
  the great archetypal ideas according to which the whole system is
  arranged. Inductive conceptions, very partially and imperfectly realized
  and apprehended by human intellect, are the exponents in our minds of
  these great principles in nature."</p>

  <p>"All science is but the partial reflexion in the <i>reason of man</i>,
  of the great all-pervading <i>reason of the universe</i>. And thus the
  <i>unity</i> of science is the reflexion of the <i>unity</i> of nature,
  and of the <i>unity</i> of that supreme reason and intelligence which
  pervades and rules over nature, and from whence all reason and all
  science is derived." (Unity of Worlds, Essay i., § ii.; Unity of
  Sciences, pp. 79 and 81.) Also he quotes from Oersted's "Soul in Nature"
  (pp. 12, 16, 18, 87, 92, and 377). "If the laws of reason did not exist
  in nature, we should vainly attempt to force them upon her: if the laws
  of nature did not exist in our reason, we should not be able to
  comprehend them." ... "We find an agreement between our reason and works
  which our reason did not produce." ... "All existence is a dominion of
  reason." "The laws of nature are laws of reason, and altogether form an
  endless unity of reason; ... one and the same throughout the
  universe."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_263" href="#NtA_263">[263]</a> In the same way Mr. Lewes,
  in criticising the Duke of Argyll's "Reign of Law" (<i>Fortnightly
  Review</i>, July 1867, p. 100), asks whether we should consider that man
  wise who spilt a gallon of wine in order to fill a wineglass? But,
  because we should not do so, it by no means follows that we can argue
  from such an action to the action of God in the visible universe. For the
  man's object, in the case supposed, is simply to fill the wine-glass, and
  the wine spilt is so much loss. With God it may be entirely different in
  both respects. All these objections are fully met by the principle thus
  laid down by St. Thomas Aquinas: "Quod si aliqua causa particularis
  deficiat a suo effectu, hoc est propter aliquam causam particularem
  impediantem quæ continetur sub ordine causæ universalis. Unde effectus
  ordinem causæ universalis nullo modo potest exire." ... "Sicut indigestio
  contingit præter ordinem virtutis nutritivæ ex aliquo impedimento, puta
  ex grossitie cibi, quam necesse est reducere in aliam causam, et sic
  usque ad causam primam universalem. Cum igitur Deus sit prima causa
  universalis non unius generi tantum, sed universaliter totius entis,
  impossibile est quod aliquid contingat præter ordinem divinæ
  gubernationis; sed ex hoc ipso quod aliquid ex unâ parte videtur exire ab
  ordine divinæ providentiæ, quo consideratur secundam aliquam particularem
  causam, necesse est quod in eundem ordinem relabatur secundum aliam
  causam."&mdash;<i>Sum. Theol</i>. p. i. q. 19, a. 6, and q. 103, a.

  <p><a name="Nt_268" href="#NtA_268">[268]</a> It seems almost strange
  that modern English thought should so long hold aloof from familiar
  communion with Christian writers of other ages and countries. It is
  rarely indeed that acquaintance is shown with such authors, though a
  bright example to the contrary was set by Sir William Hamilton. Sir
  Charles Lyell (in his "Principles of Geology," 7th edition, p. 35) speaks
  with approval of the early Italian geologists. Of Vallisneri he says, "I
  return with pleasure to the geologists of Italy who preceded, as has been
  already shown, the naturalists of other countries in their investigations
  into the ancient history of the earth, and who still maintained a decided
  pre-eminence. They refuted and ridiculed the physico-theological systems
  of Burnet, Whiston, and Woodward; while Vallisneri, in his comments on
  the Woodwardian theory, remarked how much the interests of religion, as
  well as of those of sound philosophy, had suffered by perpetually mixing
  up the sacred writings with questions of physical science." Again, he
  quotes the Carmelite friar Generelli, who, illustrating Moro before the
  Academy of Cremona in 1749, strongly opposed those who would introduce
  the supernatural into the domain of nature. "I hold in utter abomination,
  most learned Academicians! those systems which are built with their
  foundations in the air, and cannot be propped up without a miracle, and I
  undertake, with the assistance of Moro, to explain to you how these
  marine monsters were transported into the mountains by natural
  causes."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Lyell notices with exemplary impartiality the spirit of
  intolerance on both sides. How in France, Buffon, on the one hand, was
  influenced by the theological faculty of the Sorbonne to recant his
  theory of the earth, and how Voltaire, on the other, allowed his
  prejudices to get the better, if not of his judgment, certainly of his
  expression of it. Thinking that fossil remains of shells, &amp;c., were
  evidence in favour of orthodox views, Voltaire, Sir Charles Lyell
  (Principles, p. 56) tells us, "endeavoured to inculcate scepticism as to
  the real nature of such shells, and to recall from contempt the exploded
  dogma of the sixteenth century, that they were sports of nature. He also
  pretended that vegetable impressions were not those of real plants." ...
  "He would sometimes, in defiance of all consistency, shift his ground
  when addressing the vulgar; and, admitting the true nature of the shells
  collected in the Alps and other places, pretend that they were Eastern
  species, which had fallen from the hats of pilgrims coming from Syria.
  The numerous essays written by him on geological subjects were all
  calculated to strengthen prejudices, partly because he was ignorant of
  the real state of the science, and partly from his bad faith." As to the
  harmony between many early Church writers of great authority and modern
  views as regards certain matters of geology, see "Geology and
  Revelation," by the Rev. Gerald Molloy, D.D., London, 1870.</p>

  July, 1870. Those who, like Professors Huxley and Tyndall, do not accept
  his conclusions, none the less agree with him in principle, though they
  limit the evolution of the organic world from the inorganic to a very
  remote period of the world's history. (See Professor Huxley's address to
  the British Association at Liverpool, 1870, p. 17.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_281" href="#NtA_281">[281]</a> In the same way that an
  undue cultivation of any one kind of knowledge is prejudicial to
  philosophy. Mr. James Martineau well observes, "Nothing is more common
  than to see maxims, which are unexceptionable as the assumptions of
  particular sciences, coerced into the service of a universal philosophy,
  and so turned into instruments of mischief and distortion. That "we can
  know nothing but phenomena,"&mdash;that "causation is simply constant
  priority,"&mdash;that "men are governed invariably by their interests,"
  are examples of rules allowable as dominant hypotheses in physics or
  political economy, but exercising a desolating tyranny when thrust on to
  the throne of universal empire. He who seizes upon these and similar
  maxims, and carries them in triumph on his banner, may boast of his
  escape from the uncertainties of metaphysics, but is himself all the
  while the unconscious victim of their very vulgarest deception."

  <p><a name="Nt_285" href="#NtA_285">[285]</a> Thus Professor Tyndall, in
  the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of June 15, 1868, speaking of physical
  science, observes, "The <i>logical feebleness</i> of science is not
  sufficiently borne in mind. It keeps down the weed of superstition, not
  by logic, but by slowly rendering the mental soil unfit for its
  cultivation."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_286" href="#NtA_286">[286]</a> By this it is not, of

  <p><a name="Nt_290" href="#NtA_290">[290]</a> Professor Huxley goes on to
  say that the mechanist may, in turn, demand of the teleologist how the
  latter knows it was so intended. To this it may be replied he knows it as
  a necessary truth of reason deduced from his own primary intuitions,
  which intuitions cannot be questioned without <i>absolute</i>
  scepticism.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_293" href="#NtA_293">[293]</a> Dr. Asa Gray, <i>e.g.</i>,
  has thus understood Mr. Darwin. The Doctor says in his pamphlet, p. 38,
  "Mr. Darwin uses expressions which imply that the natural forms which
  surround us, because they have a history or natural sequence, could have
  been only generally, but not particularly designed,&mdash;a view at once
  superficial and contradictory; whereas his true line should be, that his
  hypothesis concerns the <i>order</i> and not the <i>cause</i>, the
  <i>how</i> and not the <i>why</i> of the phenomena, and so leaves the
  question of design just where it was before."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_294" href="#NtA_294">[294]</a> "All science is but the
  partial reflexion in the <i>reason of man</i>, of the great all-pervading
  <i>reason of the universe</i>. And the <i>unity</i> of science is the
  reflexion of the <i>unity</i> of nature and of the <i>unity</i> of that
  supreme reason and intelligence which pervades and rules over nature, and
  from whence all reason and all science is derived." (Rev. Baden Powell,
  "Unity of the Sciences," Essay i. § ii. p. 81.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_296" href="#NtA_296">[296]</a> Though Mr. Darwin's
  epithets denoting design are metaphorical, his admiration of the result
  is unequivocal, nay, enthusiastic!</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_302" href="#NtA_302">[302]</a> It may be objected,
  perhaps, that excessive delicacy of the ear might have been produced by
  having to guard against the approach of enemies, some savages being
  remarkable for their keenness of hearing at great distances. But the
  perceptions of <i>intensity</i> and <i>quality</i> of sound are very
  different. Some persons who have an extremely acute ear for delicate
  sounds, and who are fond of music, have yet an incapacity for detecting
  whether an instrument is slightly out of tune.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_312" href="#NtA_312">[312]</a> A good exposition of how an
  inferior action has to yield to one higher is given by Dr. Newman in his
  "Lectures on University Subjects," p. 372. "What is true in one science,
  is dictated to us indeed according to that science, but not according to
  another science, or in another department.</p>

  <p>"What is certain in the military art, has force in the military art,
  but not in statesmanship; and if statesmanship be a higher department of
  action than war, and enjoins the contrary, it has no force on our
  reception and obedience at all. And so what is true in medical science,
  might in all cases be carried out, <i>were</i> man a mere animal or brute
  without a soul; but since he is a rational, responsible being, a thing
  may be ever so true in medicine, yet may be unlawful in fact, in
  consequence of the <i>higher</i> law of morals and religion coming to
  some different conclusion."</p>
